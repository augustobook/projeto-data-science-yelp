No eixo x do gráfico, temos o número de avaliações por estabelecimento, que representa a quantidade de vezes que um estabelecimento foi avaliado. No eixo y, temos a avaliação média desse estabelecimento, que é a média das avaliações que recebeu.

Ao observar o gráfico de dispersão, podemos identificar possíveis padrões ou tendências. Por exemplo, se os pontos estiverem distribuídos de forma dispersa, sem uma relação clara entre a avaliação média e o número de avaliações, isso pode indicar que a quantidade de avaliações não influencia significativamente a avaliação média. Por outro lado, se houver uma tendência geral de que estabelecimentos com mais avaliações tenham avaliações mais altas (ou vice-versa), isso pode indicar uma possível correlação entre essas variáveis.


Essa visualização pode ajudar a entender se a popularidade ou visibilidade de um estabelecimento, medida pelo número de avaliações recebidas, tem algum impacto na avaliação média que ele recebe dos usuários.

Se houver uma concentração de pontos no lado esquerdo da figura, indicando que a maioria dos estabelecimentos com menor número de avaliações tem avaliações mais altas, e os pontos forem se dispersando à medida que avançam para o lado direito, onde estão os estabelecimentos com maior número de avaliações, isso pode sugerir uma possível correlação negativa entre o número de avaliações e a avaliação média.

Uma interpretação possível é que, à medida que um estabelecimento recebe mais avaliações, é mais provável que a diversidade de opiniões seja maior, resultando em uma distribuição mais ampla de avaliações. Além disso, pode haver uma maior probabilidade de que alguns usuários insatisfeitos tenham deixado avaliações negativas, diminuindo assim a avaliação média.

    'I know I shouldn\'t expect much but everything I asked for that was on the drive thru menu was not available. I was actually afraid of what I was going to get once I did get it. I saw the movie "waiting".  Word of advice stay clear of this arch. Just so you know I was only trying to order a beverage how pathetic is that. Dirty bathrooms and very slow service, but I was pleased because they had a TV on with subtitles and the volume on, and it was turned to the news!  A good place to pass some time with a tasty Mc-snack and a hot coffee while in Philly during a chilly day!  We stopped here on the way to a football game and found it a very pleasant and relaxing place to hang out for a while. That\'s a shame! \nThis place is full of junkies customers \nThe staff and the service is fast \nIt\'s just too much like homeless or you can tell the addict people all coming here and soliciting was in this location today at 4:40. I ordered two (2) angus bacon and cheese burgers. I asked for no onions which I got nothing but the cheese, pickles, bacon and meat on one and NO bacon on the other as well as the lettuce and tomatos on either. I feel completely ripped off. I also tried to order a sweet tea which the girl at the counter told me they had no ice.. Now this is the 3rd time I\'ve been told that by this location, that is completely ridiculous. You serve drinks you should have ice. This location is a very poor excuse for a restaurant! \nIf I could give this place a ZERO star I would. want some heroin with your cheese burger? this is the mcdonalds for you! I went in here for an egg mcmuffin, and it was made with the wrong kind of egg! It\'s not often I make in time for mcdonnalds breakfast, and I was really disappointed. They could have told me! Next ill go to another location... Don\'t expect any pleasantries\nHeck, don\'t expect much at all.\nDefinitely not a "Thank You for your order", or any smiles or additional service or gratitude for your patronage.  If I could prepare you to expect anything, I\'d say be ready for a run-down dilapidated franchise with ratty duct-taped chairs run by a skeleton crew of disgruntled minimum-waged part timers.  How could this system be improved? will the proposed minimum wage  hike improve friendliness and morale? Perhaps.  But for now, I just want to grab this mcmuffin and get outta here Bought a happy meal for my daughter through the app. They didn\'t honor the paid meal. I presented the receipt, they wanted no parts. They let me drive away empty handed with no meal. The customer should not be paying for the lack of communication with their partner. They could have comped under the circumstances until their communication problem was resolved. Its 11:46 am and the out buttermilk crispy tenders.... BAD MANAGEMENT ... need a New MANAGER I ordered a sausage egg & cheese mcgriddle from the drive through, and I had to pull over awkwardly and wait 15 minutes while they cooked it. It was at 9am on a weekday, why don\'t they have that ready to go? Boooooo to this McDonald\'s. Service was fast and pleasant.\n\nWhat I didn\'t like was when the lady handed me the food and she was like "here" but she said your welcome when I said thank-you. \n\nThe McDonalds got renovated at this location and it looks better. It\'s McDonalds, yo. \n\nLeast mean of them all in Philly (notice I didn\'t say nicest; truly the glass is half-empty and not half full). And least dirty. \n\nYou can see it when you spot out the singular golden arches. \n\nNo Reese\'s McFlurries, yo. Just go to another one. Place is dirty.  People in the bathroom drinking  beer, taking showers.   More like a reststop for the homeless.   Just keep going.  You will find another McDonald\'s. The employees are nice, but it\'s so slow and inefficient. Ive sat in the drive thru for more than 15 mins more than one time. If there\'s more than four cars in line don\'t even try it! This McDonald\'s location is good for uberEats and this is the way I usually order my food from this particular location. I haven\'t had any major issues with the quality of food that they provide, but sometimes my order is delivered incorrectly. I initially thought this was to the fault of the UberEats driver but I realized the order is transmitted directly to the restaurant and they make it to order before the driver is dispatched to pick up the order. \n\nI have attempted multiple times to try and eat in the dining area of this establishment but it\'s either too crowded or the service is shoddy at best. \n\nI\'ll continue to order from this place as an UberEats choice, but I\'m not too sure I\'m going to be stepping foot inside unless I visibly see it isn\'t busy. Ye gads. Literally the rudest people at the cash registers ever.  The one who took my order couldn\'t even be bothered to stand straight up. She just draped her tired body over the top of the register. God knows what buttons her boobs were pressing on the touch screen.\n\nShe laughed at what I ordered (kids meal with 4 chicken nuggets, chocolate milk, no toys needed because it was for me).\n\nMy order number on my receipt was something like 201.  They called out 101 numerous times. After waiting for quite a bit, I finally asked if 101 happened to be the same order as what my receipt showed. It was. They were just too stupid to call out 201. Updated with one extra star in recognition of their recent efforts to become ever-so-slightly less horrible. It\'s McDonalds, if you\'re looking for salty fries, a double cheeseburger and a fountain Coca-Cola after a long days work. Go and indulge.\n\nHonestly, I like this McDonalds because the staff at the windows are super nice. Things like, "here\'s your food, boss", "I like those sunglasses", they just have positive energy. I got five mc chickens and two large fries from this McDonald\'s. It was sooooo good. Literally I was in McHeaven it was sooo good. Now I know most people think McDonald\'s makes shit food but not this one. The chicken was perfectly cooked , juicy. Would recommend this McDonald\'s. If you have a craving for McDonalds don\'t expect this location to satisfy your needs.  The last time we went there they were actually OUT of burgers and last night my friend was having a Big Mac attack but they don\'t serve them on their "late night menu" AND they were OUT of coke.  Unbelievable.  If you must have McDonalds visit the location on Grey\'s Ferry over by the Pathmark instead.  The drive thru there is open 24-hours.  The Grey\'s Ferry location is also known locally as the ODB McDonalds as a rap artist known as Old Dirty Bastard was apprehended by the police while dining there. It\'s pretty bad even for a McDonald\'s, guys. For about three months after they opened, it was awesome--the staff was well-trained and polite! But now it\'s the usual tough-talking teenagers whose priorities are, in this order, 1) talking to coworkers, 2) talking on their phones... 96) running a cash register. Getting your food takes forever no matter what time of day or night. And the extremely loud TVs blaring CNN make me want to kill.\n\nIN SUMMARY\nFood freshness: cold by the time you get it\nOrder accuracy: average\nOverall staff attitude: laughably bad\nCleanliness of dining area: very good\nCleanliness of bathrooms: ?\nRefills on drinks: yes\nCondiments, napkins, utensils: out in the open\nKid\'s play area: no, although there are some perplexing McDonalds-themed souvenirs in plexiglass cases which they could look at \nDrive-through: yes This McDonald\'s doesn\'t really take your order it decides what you will have for breakfast.  I ordered 2 egg mcmuffin meals with orange juice and the restaurant decided i needed the 2 egg mcmuffin deal a hash brown and an oj which is nice and all if i was eating by myself but when my friend put his hand in the bag, his OJ and hash brown were missin, Horrible service takes 20 + minutes on McDrive to get the order done and no chance to skip the line as you stuck in it! And the funniest thing was the plate which announced \'100% customer satisfaction!\' Are you joking, Guys???\n\n-1000 stars One word to best describe it. Crazy! My gf and I came here 7:30am before work to grab a breakfast sandwich. Waited for a good time in the drive thru lane only to find out that NO ONE is taking order. We came up to the counter and a young lady was sipping her drink ignoring us. We parked the car to order inside and the door is still locked. The sign posted on the door saying that it is open at 6am. One of the chain employee is sitting outside while smoking by the side door, when I politely asked, "are you open yet miss?" She just looked at me like she is high after smoking a joint while pointing at the front door of the restaurant. I went up to the front of the restaurant only to found out that it was locked as well. Great job McDonald, I\'m not lovin it. Crispy nuggets and a quarter pounder on a French baguette. They even honored a 7:45pm reservation on a Saturday night. Great service and the restroom was immaculate. Called several times to ask if they have pancakes. They didn\'t answer, phone was ringing for a minute each time. I used to work at a McDonalds and our staff always answered the phone, sad to see this location doesn\'t do the same, despite me even calling back when they hung up on me without a greeting. I thought I called the wrong number when they hung up so I checked the numbers on google and yelp. \n\nI just wanna know. Do they serve pancakes all day at this location? How?! I just don\'t understand how!!! I know I shouldn\'t be eating fast food in the first place, but sometimes you need a little Mickey D\'s fix. Anyway... so, we decide that we\'re going to cheat today and get a couple of McGriddles, a Bacon McDouble, a shamrock shake (because, you know, it\'s that time of year), and a large coffee, black with three sugars....\nLet\'s talk about the McGriddles... I have come to LOVE these!!! And when I haven\'t had them for a while, I\'m gonna be excited to get them. But, to my chagrin the bread - the best part - was stale and hard as a rock on one of them. And both WERE NOT EVEN HOT !!!!!! Like, come on... you make me wait for a mobile order that I placed far in advance, I wait patiently in the store, and my food is not even hot?! \nThe Bacon McDouble was fine, but my coffee was gross tasting and tepid! TEPID!!!! You have a "Caution I\'m hot" message on I literally could\'ve  chugged the coffee and not get burnt. But I wouldn\'t chug it anyway, because it was GROSS!!!!!\nOh and lastly, I know it\'s McDonalds on South Philly, but can we work on customer service skills, please?!?!? Yesterday will be the last time I frequent this McDonald\'s. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with fries and a large drink it was completely busy so I waited 15 minutes for my food. when I got home, after I completed the food, within two hours my stomach was killing me. I have had terrible stomach pains and have emptied my bowels at least 25 times. Frequent this McDonald\'s with caution Doesn\'t deserve one star we waited 30 mins for our food. They let people sit inside without ordering. There were people in there drugged up falling asleep. Do not go here. This is virtually like any other McDonalds in Philly. It would be nice if they updated the decor and donated more of their moneys to charity. Stopped here last night around 10:30 pm. It took 11minutes to get my order, I must admit there was one car in front of me. The place is filthy on the outside. The food tasted like decent McDonald\'s food. They are overwhelmed by Uber eats and the owner/management hasn\'t seen fit to hire or train adequately. The staff -- including the manager -- has no real concept of customer service; not even by low McDonald\'s standards. The food is the standard adequate fare that we occasionally crave. And a craving plus the open (if less than clean) restrooms are the only reasons to come here. They all are just bullshit i saw a big hazard in my sandwich when i talked to the cashier they told me " I don\'t give a f**k we cook whatever we want" this is my advice to all of the customers who are going there please do not go to this McdDonald\'s they hired those kind of people who eats their own shit so imagine do they give a damn about you??? And i am going to sue this store because i have the proof Don\'t expect any pleasantries\nHeck, don\'t expect much at all from some of them here.\n\nDefinitely not a "Thank You for your order", or any smiles or additional service or gratitude for your patronage.  Some may do it, not all of them are that bad. But if I could prepare you to expect anything, I\'d say get ready to see a run-down dilapidated franchise with ratty duct-taped chairs run by a skeleton crew of disgruntled minimum-waged part timers.  How could this system be improved? will the proposed minimum wage  hike improve friendliness and morale? Perhaps.  But for now, I just want to grab this mcmuffin and get outta here\n\nUpdate, Breakfast Day 2 \nLook how thrashed the place is.  This morning at 10:45AM I saw a guy packing his crack pipe from a tiny plastic bag sitting in here. Iced coffee was refreshing, though.  They are slow at this McDonalds, but that\'s a common thread for all center city Philadelphia fast food places. Horrible McDonald\'s. Normally people go through the drive thru to pick up something quick... BUT NO NOT THIS ONE! It took 25 minutes to get food. Plus once we got it, IT WAS WRONG... Surprise surprise. They also were out of Diet Coke! I\'ve never heard of that! Just terrible for a service that is so simple and the workers to be incompetent. This mcdonalds has THE worst costumer service in the world. The workers are rude beyond belief. TRY to not come here if you don\'t have to. The Worst McDonald\'s ever. My childhood was filled with Happy Meals and French fries so yes, I have days where I want McDonald\'s.  Maybe once a year some years and some years once every two months. I feel like I am in a McDonald\'s anonymous meeting confessing my addiction to something I know is bad for me.  Anyways, I truly believe McDonald\'s at one time was able to make unknown ingredients, economical friendly products taste real good. BUT this McDonald\'s I believe has made it so I will not crave another Big Mac for a very long time.\n\nThis place is sloppy, service slow, rude, food to the nth degree horrible, and just really really bad. I feel like even if I made a Burger with my toes, it would be better than what I received from this McDonald\'s. I also feel bad for the students from the school across the street because this is the example of the McDonald\'s they are receiving. Hopefully it will deter them from eating it as an adult as I did today. Save yourselves! Do not go to this McDonald\'s. Poor management, incomplete inventory, place is dirty. Employees don\'t greet customers. The torn Red Furniture has been removed.  While still a low-level, low-class establishment, their disposal of these eyesores alone  is worthy of one additional star for ambience improvement. The website says this McDonalds closes at 12:00 AM; however, I just went through the drive-thru (along with 4 other cars) and all of the workers were crouched down hiding and when we knocked on the window they said it was "closed." On Wednesday I visited this McDonald\'s to make gift card purchases for an event my employer was hosting. I had to purchase 50 gift cards, which had to be individual transactions. The staff were so accommodating and patient with my request even though I know it completely disrupted business and they had to spend about 30 minutes ringing me up for each gift card. Tanisha was so helpful and understanding and I just think this store should be recognized for their customer service. Thank ya\'ll so much! Every time I go to this place they refuse to make breakfast sandwiches. At least 5 times I\'ve tried in  one week. It\'s horrible. Stay away. Definitely needed after a long day/night of drinking for Saint Patrick\'s Day. Food is what you would expect. The drinks had soda spilled all over the cups, making a mess in the car. They had us wait seven minutes to serve lunch which was kind of annoying but necessary I guess. They also forgot to give us one of our sandwiches. I do not know why I continue to come here- the food tastes like crap- and the service is even worse! I only come here for my daughter who enjoys the happy meals. Kids have some weird taste. \n\nBut I would only come back here once in a while for the fact the service always pisses me off, and whether they get the order right is hit or miss. I don\'t see how it\'s so hard working there and putting the right items in the bag. \n\nLuckily I haven\'t been to McDonald\'s in a while and this review is a couple weeks overdue! When you are thinking fast food- McDonald\'s is not the way to go! Unless you want to "go" to the bathroom right away! If I could give no starts I would. Never get the order right. Ever. No one cares. Gets it wrong when we get it sent through UberEats. I ordered three McDoubles and nuggets and they served me them with the patty off the bun the cheese wasn\'t even between the burgers and the bread was stale, if you don\'t like your job than quit. Corporate really needs to come thru and change this place and do some work. Unbelievable my nephew was upset and his nuggets weren\'t even warm they were cold like they\'ve been sitting for an hour. I get it it\'s McDonald\'s...but this was unreal listen... i get it... its McDonalds but come on! This place has the worst attention to detail i have ever had to deal with. I ordered a bacon egg n cheese biscuit with a coffee (2 creams hold the sugar). What i got? a bacon egg n cheese mcgriddle (ewwww) with  black coffee.... ugh\n\nsucks that they dont get the orders right. so be warned CHECK YOUR ORDER before you drive off...... The other reviews are correct; the service is terrible   I rarely if ever eat fast food but on the few occasions I have been there the experience was extremely poor even by McDonald\'s standards. The real concern is the activities that occur on and near the property. It appears this location is a regular "hang out" for drug users/dealers and beggars. Given all the improvements to the area, its residents would be far better served with a healthier and safer environment.  I do not expect much from a fast food restaurant but this is beyond unsafe It\'s McDonald\'s. Definitely not gourmet, but it\'s fast and convenient for the kids. At this particular location, they could have a better supply of napkins and ketchup at the customer\'s disposal, but like I said: it\'s McDonalds. You generally go in knowing what to expect. Worst. McDonalds. Ever.  They ran out of Shamrock Shake mix prior to 2pm on the day before St Patricks day.  Bad planning. i went there today. I saw 4 young ladies working and except for the nice girl working at the back window w her mask on properly, every single other employee i saw had their masks on wrong, exposing their noses. I feel like this defeats the purpose, especially when they could breathe on the food and spread covid like that. the food was decent but my 10 piece nuggets only had 9, unfortunately. This is a hard review to write because I\'ve had so many mix ups here but one top notch experience.\n\nWhen I\'m feeling weak and hungover I sometimes pop in here on my way to work for a #1 with a small oj..more times than I can remember the order gets messed up. The drive through takes forever and by the time you get your bag you\'re frustrated and late and you drive off without noticing you got a bacon biscuit sandwich instead of your egg McMuffin....devastating lol\n\nNow recently an employee was moving to california to work remotely and as his going away party we catered in McDonald\'s (kind of a gag party but you should give it a go). I went inside because I knew this wasn\'t a drive through order..I ordered probably 15 mc doubles half without onions.. 10 4 pc McNuggets.. flurries..several Big Macs..fries..pies..etc..we went all out. The woman at the counter was so nice and I got all that food faster than any drive though experience. What\'s even better is instead of ringing up everything separately she rang them in as pick twos for $4 or something...I spent way less than expected! \n\nLesson learned no drive through for me..but large orders are surprisingly a yes here! Sorry excuse of an establishment. Can\'t believe this place has the audacity to consider itself a restaurant. Incredibly long wait times even for orders placed ahead of time, rude staff, dirty interior. Don\'t do it to yourself, get chipotle next door instead- you\'ll thank yourself for it and save yourself the frustration. I loathe McDonald\'s and fast food in general, but I did go here once out of sheer desparation, hunger and broke-ass-ed-ness.  I got a $1.00 McChicken Sandwich, no pickles - It came to $1.07 and I just barely had the change scraped together.\n\nWhat a humbling experience.\n\nI pray it won\'t happen again. Had to reorder my meal twice and was wrong once I received the order. The sandwich had a plastic label inside of it. Customer service was awful!!! The staff need customer service training and safety protocol education! Found long hair in my fries on 2/7/2021. Some workers not masked. Those with masks did not have their noses covered. I would give this place 0 stars if u could. It\'s just ratchet in here. Every person that works here is ratchet. They are fighting behind the counter. They have meek mill blasting from a boom box in the back. The manager with the nasty wig is horrible too. The place is RATCHET. Takes forever to get food yet everyone is chillen in the back The worst service ever. Waiting in line with one register open but eventually 2 open. I only ordered hot cakes but took forever to get my order. I asked if they have McRib but nobody knows what it is. One girl said if I meant McGriddle. Other customer helped me to describe what it was. One girl said she didn\'t know what I was talking about. I never go back here again Gorgeous old building that used to be an 1800s commodities exchange but is repurposed to house souvenir shops and some food court type eateries.  Although the stores are cheesy, it can be a great rest stop and the inside is still stunning. The building is a repurposed commodities exchange from the late 1800\'s, so if you\'re going for the history, that\'s pretty cool. The gift shops are, well, gift shops; and the food is pretty average. It\'s definitely touristy, but certainly not trendy. \n\nDownside: Student tour groups tend to converge on the Bourse during lunch time so it can get pretty loud and overcrowded. Ah, to be young again!\n\nUpside: You can get the sightseeing tour buses and the horse and carriage rides right outside The Bourse, and you may run into Betsy Ross (I did today) or Ben Franklin! \n\nMy recommendation for those visiting Philly, consider The Bourse a pitstop but not a destination. Avoid the Asian Deli at all costs... Food looks great, but has sat out for hours at improper temperature. These people are petty theives.. Nothing is priced. In NYC this is against the law. They also do not take off the weight of the container and put your utensils on the scale. They do mention , that if you put in an extra tea bag,  it\'s 50 cents. They prey on tourists.  Take a walk a few blocks to the Reading Terminal, you\'ll be glad you did. Also, Chinatown is just a few blocks to the west.   THEY CHARGE YOU BY POUND , 8.99 FOR BANANAS AND JELLO. AVOID THIS PLACE. I\'M  a tour bus operator and this whole place is a sham. Chinese food was HORRIBLE!  Typical tourist spot with tons of children on field trips. The Bourse is a beautiful building inside and outside...\n\nBut, it\'s just a glorified food court..  Nothing "local"... It\'s all mall chain restaurants.  None are very good...\n\nYou\'re not missing much if you skip the Bourse... Highway robbery... $22 for 3 small ass ice cream cones. Tourist filled shops in a beautiful old building. Food stands around the Bourse are much cheaper and better. Avoid eating here. Confusing. Why do you need 6 different souvenir shops selling the same items in one building? It\'s like if you went to a mall that just had a dozen Old Navys. Unnecessary.\n\nAnyway, we came here for the food court, which was also a bit of a disappointment. Thankfully, this place is more or less free of food chains (at least major ones), but the options available were still bleak, especially for a vegetarian. I eventually selected a veggie burrito from the Mexican vendor, and it was acceptable, but nothing worth writing home about.\n\nI would have been most excited about the falafel place...if it had been open. It was only 5 pm on a Tuesday. Y U close so early?! Just visited the bourse yesterday and it brought back memories of when I worked next door and frequented this place for lunch.\nThe building is a work of art and worth visiting just to view the amazing architecture.\nI checked out the lunch places and they looked decent but the entire building is under construction so we didn\'t eat there, there wasn\'t really space to dine. I guess they are mainly doing take out business while the construction is underway.\nThis is a great place for tourists to grab a quick inexpensive bite to eat while visiting the historic downtown sites.\nI plan on getting your food to go and eating across the street in the park. I\'ve came in here from time-to-time after taking standardized tests in The Curtis Center to get a snack and to use the rest room before hitting the market-frankford el line. They have knick-knacky souvinear shops, some places to get some food, a random daycare center in the lower floor where the restrooms are located. The restrooms have been pretty clean everytime I went in. Good place to stop in, I would not make it a destination. My mom and I came here on a sunday when we were in town before and there was a lot closed, seems they cater to the mon-fri crowd. Rude. I walked in ordered my food and it seemed as if all the employees had not slept in days ... all angry people ... spoke in foreign language pointed at me and laughed ... then to be honest they shouldn\'t have the right to call it a "philly cheesesteak" cuz it was a poor attempt at one when I asked for my money back I was laughed at and told no .... I took about 3-4 bites. Just a nice little building to hide from the heat. It\'s just a building with food and souvenir shops. Nothing spectacular to speak of. There are a lot of shops in this mall but only on the second floor.  The first floor seemed to consist only of the restrooms (which were run down).  The shops had some cute items but were over priced!  There was also a food court but no one seemed to be eating here.  There was one lady, that managed one of the food court shops, that was throwing lettuce onto the tables to feed the birds (a few birds had flown into this building and are basically trapped).  We were thankful for the use of the free public restrooms, but that was pretty much the reason why we came and did not stay here. The Bourse is a huge building located directly parallel to Independence Mall.  Here you will find a rather large food court and assorted shops aimed at the tourist crowd.  Rocky posters, Liberty Bell shot glasses and crappy cheesesteaks are all available for your purchase. It\'s not a bad place to run into if you are in a bind for lunch, as several options are available, but if you have time, head down a couple blocks towards 3rd and Market.  If nothing else, The Bourse can be used as a convenient cut-through between 4th and 5th St. in inclement weather. I only went to the gift shops. found a different color tee in each which is Wut I was looking for. great selection. like everyone says it\'s big so maybe they will fill it up. BUT the shirts r cheaply made. they didn\'t last long. its those tourist tees that r heavy cotton. i think it depends wut kind of philly gift u r looking for. Are you from out of town and desperately seeking that crummy food court experience without actually having to go to the mall or walk a lot after visiting the Liberty Bell? \n\nDoes a visit to Independence Hall inspire you to waddle half a block for a pretty lousy lunch and some cheap souvenirs?\n\nDid the Ride the Ducks experience make your mouth water excessively because you were blowing in that silly yellow quacking device while you were being paraded across the town and you desperately need to grab a drink and and that requisite cheesesteak?\n\nIf you answered \'yes\' to any of the above questions, the Bourse is just the place for you. Essentailly it\'s a tourist trap for those seeking that generic dining and shopping experience in the heart of historic Philly. \n\nFor God\'s sake, take a risk, get some exercise, and walk seven blocks to the west and hit Reading Terminal Market for a true local gastronomic experience or go several blocks to the east for a yummy lunch on Old City. Not a fan. At all.\n\nI work in the next building over and I, too, don\'t know anyone that really eats lunch at the Bourse. Its geared  towards tourists, which is a shame. The food is mediocre at best, over priced, and all places are cash only. You have to use the ATM in the lobby & pay the fees if you don\'t have cash on you. Not cool. \n\nDepending on the time of day/year that you are there, you will probably run into class trips and lots of kids. LOTS of kids. Lots of disrespectful kids.\n\nThe only reason why I gave this 2 stars was b/c of the buffet. While the food is average, they have a decent fresh fruit and salad selection for decent prices. \n\nThere are a lot of people that work in the area that I think would eat here if they were more business friendly. Perhaps offering local delivery or at least accepting debit cards. I don\'t carry much cash on me. The whole place has just a few souvenir stores. Lots of empty space. Unless ur looking for an airport style souvenir, no reason to visit. Honestly, my expectations were set low from the start but somehow, they managed to exceed below them. First off, why don\'t they have actual names for any of their restaraunts? Not to be picky, but this made me believe that these arent actual restaraunts. Secondly, I ate at "Steaks" (for those of you who haven\'t been here, they have very straight forward names) and I had a classic philli cheese steak. Now, this being very first cheese steak, I didn\'t know what to expect. I ordered, and awaited my first bite. At first glance, the cheese steak looks as fake as it tastes. With completely artificial cheese whiz, this cheese steak tasted like B.O. I was completely astonished by this disgusting taste left in my mouth. I went back up to the counter to see if I could possibly upgrade it to the next cheese steak that had real cheese in it, and offered to pay the $1 difference. They, very rudely stated that I "would have to buy the other cheese steak and pay full price". I am completely disappointed from the terrible customer service, and bad first experience with a cheese steak. Also, in total (cheese steak, soda, and fries) my total was $15. Completely ridiculous. Ayyy. The Bourse. I think "bourse" is the French term for \'stock exchange\', which makes perfect sense here...because this place is all about getting you to exchange your moolah for overpriced food and cheap tourist crap. Ca-Ching!\n\nI\'ve worked in Old City for 2 years now, and I don\'t know ANYONE who lunches at the Bourse. For one, it\'s overpriced (I came here once my first week, and got fast-food quality chicken nuggets and fries for TEN DOLLARS (ten dollars!)); second, it\'s full of screaming elementary school children; and third, there are tons of cheaper, and...cheerier options nearby, including food carts parked directly in front.\n\nOn the plus side, the security in this place is a joke, so if you\'re looking for a venue for your indoor LARPING league, this could be your spot -- I played freeze tag here on several occasions, and it was so crowded (/security was so lazy) that we didn\'t even get caught. WOOOOOO, the Bourse! Such a shame - years ago this was THE place and had shopping and a great food court.  Now it is so dead here. And too many t-shirt/key chain vendors.\n\nSigh... I really like the architecture of this edifice.  It\'s unfortunate that the businesses on the first floor all sell either useless souvenirs that were made in China or they sell "food" that makes hospital food seem delectable.  There are eaters in there called "Chicken" and another called "Beef"\n\nMy husband and I used to take our business to Dr. Scott Bonomo of Society Hill Dental who runs his business on the 6th floor.  The first time I made an appointment with them, I told the receptionist that we were new to Philadelphia and needed to know the easiest way to find the place.   She failed to mention that the address they claim is their address, is not the same address on the street.  She gave me this address \'111 South Independence Mall E #61\', but I could not find ANY signs on the street that read \'South Independence Mall\', so I phoned to let them know that I had been lost for twenty minutes.  The same receptionist said "Well it\'s 5th street!"  I said "When I made my appointment, I told you told me to go to 111 South Independence Mall E #61, you did not tell me that you are on 5th street"  She proceeded to yell at me, telling me that I am late and had better hurry up.  I finally walked into the building, only to be confronted by 200 plus screaming junior high school kids.  I felt like I was in a nightmare.  I immediately entered an elevator, noticed that there was NO BUTTON FOR THE SIXTH floor.  I exited the elevator and the massive kids were ALL STILL YELLING. Nobody was telling them to shut the hell up.\nFinally, I tracked down a security guard, who said that I had to go to the OTHER end of the building to take the elevator that goes to the 6th floor.  Can you believe that receptionist? She hadn\'t told me that there is a SPECIFIC elevator that one must take in order to arrive on the 6th floor.   I was getting fed up at this point.\n\nI walked into Dr Bonomo\'s office, was treated with disdain by their inept and incredibly unfriendly receptionist.  I was called to the back by an \'Ivana\', who immediately stated how annoying it was that I had arrived late.  I started to tell her that THIER receptionist had given me incorrect address and directions, and she ignored me, then interrupted me.  Turns out that she is the dental hygienist. Oh joy.  She cleaned my teeth whilst asking WAY TOO MANY personal questions AND then performing the hard sell on me.  \n\nI gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back for a cleaning six months later. The receptionist and Ivana AND Dr. Bonomo were all rude to me.  This time, the hard sell from Ivana and Dr. B were particularly annoying, and Dr. Bonomo even yelled at me because I would not submit to an oral cancer test or X-rays.  Why should I?  Ivana had been very rough with my mouth after I politely declined her sales pitches.  She wanted me to buy all kinds of dental gadgets, even though I told her that I already have the same ones.   My husband also did not appreciate being treated with disdain both times that he went there, and they were more rude the second time that we went back as well as the second time I went back.\n\nThe Phila Bourse building is quite sad, really. We went here after the 2013 July 4th parade (did you see me on abc?). It was great to have a bldg so close to Independence Hall with air conditioning. We asked the security personnel for recommendations and based on what we liked, they pointed us to Bain\'s deli and Grande Olde Cheesesteaks. My bf loved his chicken salad sandwich from the deli but my cheesesteak with onions and american cheese only (no peppers) was just so-so. I also got cheese fries. I was in a cheesy mood. Why do we think cheese fries are a good idea? They almost never taste as delish as we think they will. Gloopy but passable. I got the cheesesteak, fries and drink combo for $10 but paid a little extra for cheese on fries. I would have been happier going to a restaurant and getting service for a little more money but the point that day was to beat the after-parade rush. You know what they say, out with the old, in with the new! But the in between can be a mess, lol.  Seriously though, it\'s sad to see what somehow became a thriving tourist attraction  be dismantled store by store and eventually floor by floor. However, I am super thrilled that the plans for the Bourse Building promise new grandeur - talks of upscale restaurants and sleek office spaces for tech-based companies abound. Who knows maybe we\'ll become a real Phila-cone Valley!  :-)\n\nI guess with these things on the horizon all we can do is wait and watch for the transformation. But I can\'t help but feel nostalgic. While we are dazzled by new, bright and shiny, sometimes the charm of a thing is wrapped up in it being old and familiar. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m the first one to jump at new, hip & trendy but it doesn\'t dismiss the memory and value of what once was.\n\nSo at times like these a ceremony is in order. Nothing like a good ritual to say a fond farewell and usher in new beginnings. How shall I say goodbye to this era of the Grande Dame we call the Bourse? I\'m not sure. I\'ll have to reflect for a moment. Meanwhile dear Bourse, here\'s to you & cheers to you! May your revival outshine your former glory. Beautiful old building,  but really has the appearance of a once beautiful place that\'s past its prime.  I went here as this was the starting and ending point for the trolley tours, so I went inside to kill some time before the tour started.  I was surprised to see it was much like an airport, complete with food court style restaurants and overpriced souvenir shops.   The chocolate shop was very good though.....the gentleman behind the counter was very friendly, and they had a great selection (which kept me happy on the trolley tour).   But there\'s really not much more I can say about this place. Touristy tourist, tour groups, but no tours. My friend (who\'s lived here for about 7 years,) had never been here when I first dragged her touring Old City. \nIt was a September day, a bit windy from Penn Landing probably and the kiddies were not around. There were many hipsters and elderly groups milling about so we took our coffee and went outside to the area that has some tables and chairs looking out the better side of this "shopping mall". You can watch the horse and carts clop along the road here. The other side is depressing, people plop down on the stairs and look kind of homeless and depressed. Needless to say we didn\'t have lunch here. The place we got coffee (and a bagel and muffin which were good,) last Autumn wasn\'t too bad but there was no privacy inside.\nLast week it hadn\'t changed. Not that I\'m surprised about that. I didn\'t go to the Bourse for the history this time. If it didn\'t have it\'s own website touting it and wasn\'t included on many of the historical sites, you\'d have no clue there was anything important about it. It inspires anxiety and crushing humanity in anyone that is looking for a unique experience. And I don\'t mean in the Grand Canyon sense. More along the Penn Station in NY sense. So why did I go last week? I knew I would get some kind of souvenir. I went to what I thought might be a family type place. It was in the middle of the concourse and started with a "V" (BTW whoever deals with their website should really update the names of the shops.) I got "some souvenirs" for sure. Shame on me for thinking I\'d get something of value. Two of the 7 items I got were broken. Cheap-@ssed cr@p. It wouldn\'t have made me so mad except that I thought the owners were very accommodating. Yeah, to get me to buy some over priced teddies that had nothing to do with Philadelphia. Anyway I won\'t be doing that again. For less than the price of a broken laser (yeah it was for a freaking cat but the screw top that kept the batteries in was broken,) I got a reusable coloring mat and special crayons at the Fireman\'s Hall Museum. \nWhatever. Lesson learned.\nI should have left the minute I saw at least 300 teeny-boppers, 100 girl scouts, 200 cub scouts and various young adults and bewildered elderly people packed in the lower level. It was a nasty show of humanity and consumption that only politicians love to see. You can even see an example of what I\'m talking about at their website.\nDo yourself a favor; buy from the Franklin Court, browse the Franklin Institute, or just go to the Dollar Value and fake it. DO NOT BOTHER with the Bourse. Somebody tell the city that this place really doesn\'t represent history! (Hmmm, maybe it really does?)\nP.S. My friend was spared the ugliness by waiting for me outside on the steps as she had a smoke.\n\nhttp://www.bourse-pa.com/index.html This place was definitely made for tourists. \n\nThis building is comprised of namely 2 things - souvenir shops & a food court. \n\nThere are different floors to go explore - so if you are in the market for all things Philadelphia - come here. \n\nGo Eagles!\n\nPosted Photos. What a beautiful building!  Walk inside and look up.  It really is beautiful architecture.  Now that I\'ve said something positive I\'ll move on.\n\nYou go here if you are a tourist.  It has every Philly souvenir store imaginable.  It\'s definitely a one stop shop for Philly stuff and for that it\'s convenient.\n\nIt has a large food court with all the usual chain suspects.  I\'d rather have a double root canal with no pain meds than have lunch here!\nI might, maybe, occasionally, if I\'m desperate, by a coffee here.  Other than that I\'ll pass. What happens to a dream deferred?\nDoes it yell across the floor \nat the other teenagers on its field trip?\nOr fester like a Rocky-themed souvenier shop--\nThen overcharge for a terrible cheese steak and only accept cash?\n\nMaybe it just sags\nlike the faces of office workers desperate to leave the office for lunch on a day too cold to eat outside\n\nOr does it explode? There is a variety of food here, and the building has interesting architecture.  We tried food from 3 different places.  Generally it was OK for a quick lunch in the area, but nothing great.  The restrooms are inconveniently located downstairs - and they were pretty gross.  Maybe that\'s why they put them in the basement with minimal lighting. Bad bad horrible!!!\n\nThere is a "philly cheese steak" breakfast/lunch place in the first floor of this food court.\nWe were on a east coast tour and our bus stopped here for food after the independence hall visit on Wednesday, May 31 morning.\n\nThe experience was very bad. We were treated badly with racial comments from a waitresses of this restuarant - a Korean lady, who herself was an Asian!! No other waiters/waitresses from the restaurant opposed this. The owner of the restaurant was no where and did not even care to respond or look what\'s going on. We stepped out of the restaurant and just went to a different place near by.\nBecause of such experiences, people/tourists get very bad impression about the state and the country.\n\nIt will be good if the owner of this place can look into the matter and help to refrain from such rude behavior!! My boyfriend and I needed to stay indoors during our trip in Philadelphia since it was so hot so that\'s why we also decided to visit the Phila Bourse Building. It has great air conditioning.\n\nI don\'t quite understand why there are 6-7 souvenir shops selling the same items on one floor. There\'s a lot of seating area and a small food court. \n\nThere\'s a couple of floors that are vacant and I feel they should definitely do something about it and try add more shops to it. The Phila Bourse Bldg is definitely not a place that\'s very appealing and attractive. Although if you find yourself sweating to death in the area, this is a good place to sit and relax for a bit. Hey Bourse! \nKeep your chin up! A lot of people like to hate on you, but you\'re not so bad! Sure, you have some overpriced souvenir shops, but really...what touristy area of ANY city doesn\'t?! And you have a Penzey\'s?!?! Hello!!! A Penzey\'s! Now, that\'s a draw. The food stalls are mediocre and way too expensive, but the Mexican one is the BEST in Old City! It kinda has to be...the Consulate General of Mexico is in the house (literally, upstairs). So as a one-stop shop for souvenirs (priced the same as the rest of the shops in Old City), Mexican lunch, and spices, you rock! Keep it up!\nYour Friend,\nThat Yelper Passing Through\nPS-Your history and architecture make you double-rock! Our Bus Tour guide chose to take us here for breakfast as soon as we entered Philadelphia. The building looks great. I particularly like the old architecture inside and outside the building. The stairs inside look grand. We don\'t have building this old and beautiful in a new city like Vancouver, BC where we are from. We had pre-ordered breakfast consists of noodle, soya sauce boiled egg and congee.There are lots of shops selling interesting goods and souvenirs. There is no shortage of school kids on their field trip. A renowned Philadelphia landmark. Definitely a great tourist attraction. If you are looking for a place to grab food quickly during lunch, this is your place.  Just beware that there are a million + pre-teens/teens floating around at lunch time which makes it kind of chaotic (and honestly annoying). I seen this building over the years and never knew what it was since I was bar hopping at night. On top of that, i never bothered to inspect it during the day since the area is touristy. \n\nThe architecture is really nice! I was intrigued (and hot) so I decided to walk through it one day after lunch. I always wondered why Philadelphia lacked "touristy" areas like other big cities that sold souvenirs and a food court\'ish place for convenience. Then I realized, The Bourse is exactly what I was thinking of.. Unfortunately, the interior is very dated and felt like I was in the 90\'s. \n\nFood stalls are your typical names and fare (pizza, sandwiches, Chinese, etc.) The souvenir shops are fun and good for the average tourist since other places are usually located outdoors, you get the benefit of AC during the summer, and heat during the winter. \n\nWith so many food options in and around Old City, it is definitely difficult to justify spending money here if you are a local. For the average tourist, I\'d opt for something small to hold you over and then head to a restaurant/café within the 2-3 block radius. Or just go here to take refuge from the heat. \n\nI would suggest Philly invest some money to update the place (interior), but I\'m not sure if that would entice new vendors or businesses (upper floors) to rent here. A Reading Terminal\'esque food hall may do well. NYC benefits from having a robust tourist economy all year round, so they are able to sustain 4+ food halls, despite being in close proximity to one another. I can only wish... I am only giving 5 stars because the Shamrock Shake is back and delicious!! Too bad it\'s around only once a year ;( A McDonald\'s seems so out of place here amogst the shi-shi shops on Walnut Street.  That and it is a haven for local down & outs seeking a $1 McChicken and a coke or coffee.\n\nI rarely ever set foot in here. (But admittedly I have once or twice.)\n\nYick! McDonald\'s Fries are not vegetarian, are not free from Dairy or Wheat. \n\nThey also contain hydrogenated oils. Blah. \n\nIts just odd that french fried potatoes contain wheat, dairy, and beef  "products" Slowest McDonald\'s I have ever been to. 22 minute wait for a few burgers and fries. This place is a mess. didn\'t even order, just  used the bathroom. probably one of the top 5 best experiences of my life It\'s always a little groady and a little slow.  You\'re lucky if you can get a seat in there or your food.  I somehow get skipped often at this place for simple things like a McDouble.  Murrr. Pretty much like a regular McDonald\'s, except cleaner compared to Philly standards. It\'s location is well suited in case you\'re out partying in the city (close to many clubs and bars), and can serve as a great midnight snack if you live in the Rittenhouse neighborhood. Big Mac party is open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays.. The lines can get long .. But what do expect at 3:30am Not terrible in a pinch however I ordered two Big Mac meals with shakes and some BBQ and sweet and sour sauce with Uber eats. I received a call with the infamous our shake machine is broken so we got charged extra for something we didn\'t even get. Lastly we got honey mustard instead of BBQ sauce which is just the icing on the cake. Staff is extremely unprofessional and it\'s dirty...I refuse to set foot in this specific McDonalds... I actually got happy seeing those arches!\nAfter several days of spending way too much at restaurants, (Yep-tourist here!) \nI decided I needed a Big Mac to even the score.\nThe evening manager on July 21st was so very hostile!\nI went to the counter and ordered the Monday night special....Big Mac and fries for 4 bucks? I\'m in! And then I asked if they had Sundays as I didn\'t see it on the menu board.\nThe nice young lady didn\'t quite catch what I asked and when she asked me to repeat it, and she asked VERY POLITELY, the manager rushed to the counter GLARING at me. Maybe I look like his ex wife who got the car, the house the kids, his dignity?\nAll I can say is that he was ANGRY, and it was directed at me. I was so shocked I was actually slightly amused at the pure hatred coming out of his eyes.\nI was too hungry....too tired.... He placed my bag on the counter and stormed away before I could ask for salt and Ketchup.\nWhich are behind the counter.\nI stepped back over to the cashier area as Mr. Crabby was now ignoring me.\nAfter waiting while the cashier batted her lashes and dip head grinned the guy who was at the counter, I caught Mr. Crabby coming my way. Great I thought.\nBut he wasn\'t helping me, he came up to the register and did the buddy fist bump thing to Mr. Charming and told him his food was being comped. \nCan you comp me some salt and Ketchup I thought?\nluckily for me, a young lady came back from break or what have you and yay! I got my condiments!\nThe food was McDonalds good. I have to give em that.\nBut the filth, the hostility, Yeah no thanks. Don\'t understand why it says 24 hours when it\'s not , then a sign Says 12 pm it\'s 1120 and there shut down we walked 3 blocks for nothing The service is really and unprofessional. I have been sitting here for over 20 minutes. This is not what I call FAST food. Well, I liked it. Great location, nice alternative for someone who doesn\'t want to pay $15 for a lunch at one of the other places around. Fresh food as far as I can tell! I love McDonald\'s I came in and my boy Jeffry greeted me and I knew it was home from then. I\'ve been there every day of the week for 7 months and I\'ve loved it  I\'ve gained 21 pounds since then and I weigh 224 pounds I\'m getting fat but I don\'t give a shit (don\'t report me) it has been an amazing 7 months and I hate Chick-fil-A now. If you see a man with green hair it\'s me and I will greet you with McDonald\'s tritition and buy you a cookie. Amen my brothers I just had the best McDonald\'s experience I ever had. The staff was incredibly nice, gave me some coupons to use, and they even had a variety of condiments available to use (sriracha on McDonald\'s fries? Yes Please!). This was the worst McDonald\'s ever.  I ordered a Bacon Big Mac and got a regular Big Mac.  The waitress didn\'t know how to use the computer or something.  It was horrible.  I miss California I\'m never getting McDonald\'s in Philadelphia again.\n\nUpdate: I ordered another Bacon Big Mac.  I had to ask if they had bacon twice before she asked her manager how to use the computer.  My friend ordered bacon cheese fries twice and got medium fries twice.\n\nWorst place ever. This McDonald\'s is a disgrace, I was in there July 4,2018 around 11pm I walked in and after ordering the very large group of black youths (30 or more)surrounded me and started yelling gay slurs and harassing me.i asked for help from the girls behind the counter as I was waiting 20 minutes and no way out for me to leave, they ignored me. No manager showed herself till the incident was over. I called the police as I was being threatened. The out of control young adults  robbed my iPhone and ran out mocking and celebrating. I spoke to McDonald corporate office and GM they did nothing to help or compensate me in anyway! The Gm spent more time telling me he was a minister and how his car was broken into near that same store days before.\nThis store and McDonald needs to be held responsible for actions that occur in there store.#mcDonalds #dotherightthing How can you screw up a fast food restaurant besides actually opening one? \n1) You put one in the center of Rittenhouse shopping district.\n2) Employ people from south and north Philadelphia, \n3) Undertrain and underpay them so they will give two sheets about your food or customer service and while the waiting time on the cash register might say 20 seconds in reality it\'s more like 4-5 minutes because the employees have to discuss the hierarchy of the word "Son" and how it should be used, I mean where is the fast in fast food? Maybe Merriam-Webster should consider employing them...\n4) Close the upper floor so people will cram into the "roomy" first floor and oh, don\'t forget to systematically limit the amount of "free" things such as ketchup, knives ad forks, and now even straws.\n\n*A special ode to their white unicorn that goes under the name of Mayonnaise: Captain Ahab  had more chances of catching Moby-Dick than you getting mayonnaise in this Mickey\'D...they either don\'t have it or they have it and feel like it\'s their teenage daughter who is about to go to prom and you are her date who is also a future Ted Bundy. One of the employees even tried to charge me a dollar once. L A U G H A B L E The Food at this McDonald\'s is good.  I always get my food nice and hot.  The only thing that makes this location bad is the fact that the service is horrible.  You place your order and sometimes have to wait 10 minutes just to get your food.  Even when there is no line. Dirt McGirt? Dirt McGirt? Dirt McGirt?\n\nOh, no, it\'s only you, Ron McDon.\n\nIf ODB were still with us today, after a shopping excursion to these cultural nether regions, he\'d be sittin\' here, clownin\', jokin\', chowin\' down alongside the hungry masses of weary, trendy shoppers or whoever it is that really dines here at this McDonald\'s location. McSpicy Paneer? Yeah! I think he\'d like some of that. Maybe a McRib as well. And an apple pie for dessert. Yeah, Dawg. I took off another star because this place has no dollar menu.  But, the service is usually consistent along with the food. They are also open until 4 AM Friday & Saturday. Fair warning, though, you might be waiting an 45 minutes-hour for your order after the bars close. It becomes a mad house. If you\'re partying in the area or here after-hours, this McDonald\'s is one of your fine dining choices. Heck, even if you\'re shopping and have the urge to eat a McChicken, here you go.\n\nIt\'s cheap, and if all you want is Chicken McNuggets to slow the effects of booze on your bloodstream, there you go.\n\nIf only they had booze. I\'ve been to a lot of McDonald\'s restaurants in this area but this was my first time at this location. Service here is really not bad, it all depends on what time you go. I\'m pretty sure they don\'t give you trays in case you are dining in. I ordered a chocolate chip frappe with no whip. Doesn\'t seem that difficult for such a common item. Yet for some reason, it was havoc. \n\nI got a caramel frappe with whip. I asked for my correct order and they decided to give me a chocolate chip with whip again. I asked them to change it, and they scooped out half my drink to get the cream out. \n\nIn the end I got half a chocolate chip frappe with whip cream residue. Also,  my frappe was SOUR. Um, expired milk, perhaps?\n\nThis place is also disgustingly dirty. this McDonald\'s is by far the WORST I have been too! All of the employees are rude! They don\'t give you want you ask for. The customer service here is terrible. The cashier who took my order was very rude. I asked her if I could have fresh fries and she blatantly ignored my question. I asked her if the fries were fresh and she said in a little rude and snotty way "no". They gave me a large drink when I asked for medium. The associate who gave me the food was very rude as well when I asked her why was I given a large coke when I didn\'t ask for one? She nonchalantly brushed me off as well. My fries weren\'t fresh! I had to ask for fresh fries and the associate who gave me my food was very rude about it! As if she didn\'t want to give me fresh food, as if this isn\'t her job! Nonetheless, the employees in the back who were preparing the food were coming up to the front and gossiping amongst each other. In a nutshell, don\'t come here! This is a mcdonald\'s so there\'s not too much to say. If you live under a rock and you\'ve never been then you must try their french fries, nuggets, big macs, and fish filets (not the bites). What\'s nice about this location is it\'s open until 4am on the weekends. It\'s the perfect place to go after a night of drinking, especially because you won\'t be judged. Not one person even batted an eye as my friends and I sat there stuffing ourselves with nuggets while singing part of your world from the little mermaid. The employees were okay, they were nice enough, but not overly friendly. They took a solid 15 minutes to prepare my meal (everyone else who ordered, both before AND after me) received their meals. Tables were okay, slightly dirty, doesn\'t look like anyone cleans the tables off in between customers. My chicken nuggets were hard. This is one of those odd instances when I know going in that nothing I write in this review will change a thing. The parent company will make money no matter what I write, this location will make money no matter what I write, so I will take solace in the idea that I will save at least a few drunk people. \n\nSO here\'s the sitch, as someone said in their review. I understand that the employees are underpaid and have to deal with the worse that humanity has to offer but good lord all I want is some food, and I\'m ALWAYS sober when I come in (I\'ve usually just finished making other people drunk)\n\nI\'ve come here before and the service is ungodly slow. I always order the same thing (breakfast for dinner) my average wait time for it to be made, 22 minutes. That\'s right it takes this place an entire episode of How I Met Your Mother to make a sausage mcmuffin with egg. Tonight I went in because I had 40 minutes before my next train. I ordered two sausage mcmuffins and 6 nuggets......Yep you guessed it, I missed my train.\n\nFinal thought: I know you\'re probably drunk when you go here but do yourself a favor walk the two blocks to Wawa or around the corner to Little Pete\'s Hell you\'ve got to be crazy to eat at this McDonalds. I have never seen such lewd behavior. I was trying to enjoy my meal, and 5 employees were hanging out making lewd comments about a customer that they knew saying that he smells like horse piss. I have never witnessed such disgusting behavior. I asked the employees to please stop making those comments because I was trying to enjoy my meal then one of the managers that was part of that group started making threats to me saying things like who are you getting loud with, and asking me for a fight. I was trying to explain that I am not getting loud, but I just didn\'t want to hear those comments. I really don\'t want to fight when I tried to walk away he pretended like he was about to run after him, and that\'s when the corporate manager got ready to run from around the desk. Unfortunately, a dollar to late, and one happy meal to late. I\'ve already been insulted, and threatened I thought about going to the cops, but instead decided to complain to the corporate manager, which he wrote down on a piece of paper, and probably filed it under t for trash, so if you want to go to where you can hear a bunch of lewd comments from employees there, and be threatened just come to the McDonald\'s on Walnut Street. The least ghetto McDonald\'s in the area. The only other one is over on broad. No thanks. Overall it\'s fast and accurate. I never had a problem here. Then again I am not a commuter and also never came here with the rest of the drunks at 2am. It does have a preponderance of homeless people who harass diners for a " dolla yo so I can git a hamabuga". \n\nDon\'t give them any money. McDonald\'s takes food stamps when you are homeless. They want to buy drugs. You\'re not helping anyone when you give them money. \n\nOh the fries are hot and fresh. \n\n-1 Star for the low lives and skells in the vicinity. It\'s an urban McDonald\'s...\n\nThe clientele there are often the homeless. The staff is rude, loud, and exhibit uncouth behavior. Outside the door, homeless men will often beg and yell at you for change and one becomes belligerent if you ignore him.\n\nPros:\n~They\'re open 24 hours.\n~They\'re selection is as good as any other McDonald\'s. I love McDonald\'s I came in and my boy Jeffry greeted me and I knew it was home from then. I\'ve been there every day of the week for 7 months and I\'ve loved it  I\'ve gained 21 pounds since then and I weigh 224 pounds I\'m getting fat but I don\'t give a sh** (don\'t report me) it has been an amazing 7 months and I hate Chick-fil-A now. If you s a man with green hair it\'s me and I will greet you with McDonald\'s tritition and buy you a cookie. Amen my brothers The service here is terrible. Look at this full house but the employees have placed all of the chairs on the tables as if it were closed.\n\nLast time we were here they were so rude - it seems like they\'re being intentionally slow as to dissuade new business. Staff is extremely unprofessional and it\'s dirty...I refuse to set foot in this specific McDonalds, one star is too high of a rating for this mess of an "establishment" This is the worst McDonald\'s I\'ve ever been to in my life, the guy who took my order (blonde tips over his nasty hair) was so damn rude. I ordered a #9 meal, which was supposedly suppose to come with two cheeseburger, only came with one cheeseburger. He was mumbling and not speaking clearly enough for me to hear, I thought he said what sauce, side, etc? Then this rude ass guy started raising his voice at me and was like, "NO, I SAID SIZE!!! Thinking that I don\'t speak English perhaps? At that moment, I should\'ve just walked the fuck out, don\'t nobody raise their voice at a customer. He clearly is not educated enough to be working at "McDonald\'s", please fire him. You guys will be losing a lot of business from his lack of clarity and unclassy customer service. This place is the worst. Staff is the only reason it\'s 2 stars. They were very understaffed and I had to wait about 40 min for a simple order. Management need to take a look at how busy this location gets at night Went in because I needed to sit down on my laptop for 20 minutes and they have WiFi. The ING Direct and Starbucks nearby were packed. I ordered a large unsweetened iced tea. The menu said "Iced Tea $1.00" and underneath that "Sweet Tea" with no additional price, so I presumed both were $1.00. In fact I was charged $1.08.\n\nThen AFTER I paid the cashier informed me that the unsweetened iced tea was actually around $3.00, so I would be getting sweet tea; "That\' ok?" No, it\'s not ok. I\'m diabetic. After much reluctance and a healthy side of \'tude I was given what I originally ordered, and I\'m glad I could see it being poured because I wouldn\'t have been surprised if it was otherwise spat in.\n\nI had hoped to go to their upstairs seating area to avoid the riff-raff of drug addicts, sleeping homeless people and general obnoxious ghetto folk, only to attempt the door and discover it was locked. So I sat in the window as far away from everyone as possible, did my internetting and got the hell out of dodge.\n\nThe two stars is because the internet connection was fast and reliable. I\'m not normally one to complain about a McDonald\'s, cuz let\'s be real, they are low paid people who stand there all day and most of the time deal with drunks or trash. But every part of my interaction this evening was awful, the cashier girl moved at a tortoise pace and looked at me like I had five heads at every question I asked...i also asked for jalapeños on my burger but they didn\'t have jalapeños which was bizarre to me because, how are you going to have a jalapeño double without the main ingredient...I was only told that AFTER already having swiped my card and then was asked if I would like a sauce instead, I politely declined and asked for a refund to my card (which wasn\'t a lot but when your pinching pennies...) the manager then reaches into his pocket and tries to hand me change, which btw is illegal, look it up..\nAfter finally being refunded I asked for\nSome bbq sauce, for my fries, again the cashier looks at me like I had five heads and tells me it\'s 27 cents....I\'ve never ONCE paid for one thing of sauce, knowing people that work at mcd\'s your first sauce is free, second one you pay for (dependent upon the proprietor) on top of that I was given old\nFries that were sitting in the bottom of the "heater" \nI left feeling very frustrated and hated myself for it...needless to say I will not be going back to this location, unless they can fix\nSome things I\'ve lived in Philly for over a year and this place is never open. It says "24 hours" but it\'s not. Greatly dislike the misrepresentation (update your hours!!) Completely messed up my order. Gave me items I didn\'t ask for and couldn\'t eat. Wouldn\'t give me my money back. Don\'t come to this location. There\'s better ones within walking distance. Went there to get lunch while working in center Cory today. Ordered a Quarter pounder meal and asked for fresh fries. With a line of about 6 people in front of me, I asked to have my fries FRESH. The cashier who\'s name is "Nadira" gave me attitude asking why do I need fresh fries? I politely told her there was a line and by time I get my food the fries will be cold. She told the girl making the fries to drop more fries. The other girl making the fries asks why do we need more fries. Nadira says in a very sneer manner "Because this guy wants his fries fresh and thinks they will be cold by time he gets his food" I asked Nadira "why does it seem like it\'s a problem to ask for fresh food?" She neglected my question and said "$9.06 please." I repeated myself and asked the question again. She replied once again "$9.06" I declined service and walked out. \n\nI don\'t know who the manager, supervisor or lead team members is but no paying customer should have to deal with these peoples shitty attitudes. There\'s this one lady who works here. Dreads, slightly crossed eyes, african american, works nights, said her name was China or something? She needs to be fired asap. Every time I go into this place she is treating the customers with zero respect like the customers are inconveniencing her. I one time watch her not say one word to 4 customers in a row. Even when they asked questions she would ignore them. Everyone in line just looked at each other in confusion. Never have I ever seen such disrespect in my entire life. Who is the owner or manager of this terrible establishment? How does she even have a job? This franchise definitely give mcdonald\'s a very bad name. I know that  there is someone begging at the door at times, and I know there are some rather unusual people sitting in the front of the restaurant; but I think the staff is nice and friendly and the food is always hot and fresh. I don\'t give money to the folks at the door and they\'re usually respectful and don\'t get in your face or really bother anyone at all. I do feel guilty about eating there because let\'s face it, I\'m not there for a salad, I\'m there for a Big Mac and other versions of their delicious burgers and lots of Diet Coke. I also feel guilty about the unfortunate folks at the door and that I\'m eating basically unhealthy food (feeding my processed food addiction) near people who want money to feed their addictions too. There is a sad irony about the human condition that screams in mind when I go there. My processed food addiction, their various addictions, the desperation, OMG if you can overcome all of that, and hang back with the staff near the register, it\'s not a bad experience :)\n\nSo the staff are really nice and patient. For a while they stopped calling it "special sauce" and started calling it "Mac sauce" (I think it was generational because the younger staff didn\'t know what it was) but today on a commercial I heard the announcer call it "special sauce" again so maybe it\'s throwback Monday? The service is terrible here -- 4 people working as a cashier but no one is taking orders, just talking to each other. The manager was nearby but didnt seem concerned and also was participating in the talking. I\'m not really sure how this McDonalds stays open in the area, especially without a renovation and some new staff.  Lots of better \'fast food\' nearby with workers who will actually take your order. No one at this location cares, in fact you are bothering them, tried to send me out with my to go order short 2 cheeseburgers, and no drink, literally half my order. Then they copped an attitude when I asked for the items I paid for, this started a "it\'s your fault" argument between the employees, the only one even attempting to try was the lone cashier, there was a short Hispanic girl is a red McDonald\'s uniform that was playing grab ass and yell at the employee that was supposed to be cooking(I think she is sweet on him).\n \nWhen I asked for my drink the first time, the woman that was only oversalting the fries and handing out orders barked at the cashier to give me my drink after asking me what drink I was Spose to have instead of looking at the pull sheet attached to the damn bag she gave me.\n\nI remembered they forgot my nugget sauce last time so while waiting for my drink I looked in the bag, they nailed giving me my sauce and shorted me two cheeseburgers.\n\nWhoever runs this place should fire everyone, close down, clean the place like it\'s getting ready for a grand opening and hire new staff, I know it\'s McDonald\'s but damn y\'all just don\'t care The food is good at McDonald\'s but the service in the drive threw always sound so lazy like they don\'t want to work there! And even the inside is VERY sticky and gross I recommend the drive threw. There best food is the fries the filla o fish is trash I highly DONT recommend that. I don\'t know who would get fish from a fast food resturant. Highly recommend going to Burger King or something. Burger kings\'s taco is probably better then filla o fish. Clientele= horrible\n\nBusy location\n\nStaff-  nice here\n\n"You don\'t want no drink?"  \n\nAt least they ask& Do their job\n\nExtra star for the presence of tapatío on the premises\n\n\nLong lines at 1:00 AM\n\nGod bless these people They have to buzz you into their bathroom.  You wait by the door and then, if you\'re lucky, they decide you\'re good-looking enough to get into their special club.  \n\nAfter entering the locked door, you walk up a set of secret back stairs to "Club McDonalds"-- the after hours bathroom club, with the hottest music and a huge disco ball.  All of the toilets are studded with swarovski crystals and the bathroom is lit in with a blacklight.  When you flush, it sets off a strobe light and everyone goes crazy dancing.   The floors are lit from below; colored lights flash as you wash your hands-- nodding your head in time with the music.  You walk back downstairs and open the door back to the regular McDonalds; blinded by the fluorescent light.  You shudder as you sit down with your fast food; saddened to be back with the McDonald\'s "regular people."\n\n\nThat is all a lie, but they do have to buzz you into their upstairs bathroom and it is weird and sometimes it takes a while and you\'re just standing there like "Im sad can you let me in please" all mcdonalds are not equal! \n\nthere are a few problems with this one that make me hesitant to come here. first, there is always a funky stench immediately when you walk into this location.  its not the smell of fried food, but almost like the smell of a bus on a rainy day, which is NOT what you want your local mcd to smell like.  next, the ice cream machine is consistently out of service or down for cleaning.  i am not kidding, one out of every two times i try to come here for a cone i am turned away because the machine isnt working.  lastly, the fries here aren\'t fried as well, sometimes they are undercooked. i love mcd french fries, so it makes me sad that the ones here are inconsistent with that of other mcdonalds. \n\ni feel a little bad leaving a bad review for mcdonalds, because the people who work here are generally nice, but this mcd has to step it up! It was OK , i wont be going back, people coming up to the table passing out flyers disrespectful the waitress not remembering our order, just messy. one and done. The drinks was strong the food was good I recommend this place I was there yesterday celebrating a friends birthday I will be making another visit sometime this month I get a space of thumbs up Over priced drinks, mixing 4 or 5 different liquors and adding juice should NOT cost 15.00, and its not top shelf liquor either.  2 crab clusters and 2 pieces of corn should NOT cost 25.00! It\'s a shame since I live right up the street, I keep trying to give this place a chance, but every time I leave disappointed. I\'m not even going to speak on the horrible parking. ..this place sucks ass ! Great drinks. Good ambiance. Nice set-up. Waitress was a little slow, but once it started flowing, everything was good.\nI can\'t wait to get back up there and order a plate of dungeness crabs. *drool* Good food. Awesome drinks. Can definitely get crowded during the weekend night life hours. The shrimp scampi was well seasoned and the mini crab balls were good. The mussels could\'ve had more butter on them though. Fried shrimp was seasoned well and fried to perfection. Nothing makes me happier than being able to add an extra star on Chuck\'s Alibi. I like this place so much, that despite my moving about 30 minutes away I decided half way through my meal that I\'ll be making the trip back often! \n\nAs I mentioned in my last review, all the negatives couldn\'t keep me away from the positively great crabs. So with a bit of mental preparation we stopped by Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised to find EVERY ONE of our previous issues had been addressed! We arrived toward the end of what I would call dinner hours (they serve late into the evening though) and the ambiance was  very pleasant. Frank Sinatra serenaded us at a ear friendly volume as we went to town on our Dungenous crabs. Late in our meal the clock did click passed 9 and the music got a tad louder and went to typical bar music, but still no where near the ear splitting level of before. In fact, I didn\'t see the guy that was running things on our last visit, and this time the manager in charge (an obvious seasoned veteran of the service industry, and an obvious positive influence on the business) made a point to go around to all the tables to check on things. The temperature problems seemed to be worked out too. \n\nIf you haven\'t been, do yourself a favor and give them a try. Also, they have their own private parking lot with free valet, so don\'t stress about parking. Chuck\'s is a mix between a local pub, an Atlanta club and diner. I am merely reviewing the night life here because I came here for drinks on a Fri night. \n\nThe music was by far the BEST part of this friday night experience. It was all old school Mase, 112, SWV, perfect for a few drinks....and maybe a shot.  \n\nI would definitely return, everyone seemed to be enjoying their meal, unfortunately I did not stay much past midnight as I had to work the next day. Every single time (which is 2) ive eaten here the food is delish and then i have diarrhea for the rest of the evening......draw your own conclusions I went with a couple of my gfs at 9:30 on a Friday night. The atmosphere is a very chill and laid back place. The place got pretty packed by 11PM. They have daily specials on drinks as soon as you walk in the door. They have $6 margarita specials on Friday. I thought the margarita\'s would be watered down because of the special but it was strong!!! The food was almost perfect but because of the you peel shrimp I am giving this place a 4 star instead of 5. It was toooo salty and spicy because of the buttery/old bay sauce it was in. Don\'t get me wrong...the sauce was good BUT I wish they had it on the side so I could dip my shrimp. Also, the bathroom is not clean!! But it\'s a bar so what do you expect?? No paper towels and hand dryer is broken Went here on Sunday to attend an album release party so I was not dining in (and from the other reviews, I should count my blessings!) In the back of the restaurant through the doors is a really nice, intimate venue. It\'s ashame the bartenders suck... The bar was extremely crowded so I understood the long wait, however generally if there\'s and event , most places will staff more than one bartender. Its a novel idea, but it just might work! \n\nSo after my friend and I got tired of waiting we went to the.main bar and the chick bartending had the nastiest attitude and horrible customer service. She proceeded to walk past us twice and serve other customers eventhough we told her we\'d like to order, and the other patrons came up after us. So we went back to the slow bartender. And after he took 25 mins to get our order and spent another 20,mins reading the ingriedients on the menu to make our carribean punches we got our drinks in less than an hour. Based on that experience I would NEVER patronize the restaurant plus the parking situation is atrocious. Sux too cause the drink actually turned out good... While Chuck\'s is famous for its seafood, I have been twice in a week and have been very disappointed with the quality of food. Both times I got the whiting platter and both times it was poorly seasoned. I hope they can get it together soon but I won\'t be back for a while. It\'s is horrible here service sucks. It\'s a shame the neighborhood is changing and you can tell by this place. It\'s so ghetto here I mean really ghetto. This place sucks. The food was dried out and the server you could tell was more worried about her weave then serving us. Stay away from this place. We stopped here and my boyfriend was actually frisked before we were allowed inside? Drinks are way overpriced, music is horrible thug rap that is much too loud. We were starving so we both ordered cheesesteaks with mushrooms on toasted rolls. We got a cheesesteak, no mushrooms, bread untoasted. Bartender was rude and inattentive, eventhough the place was not that crowded. The bar and restaurant look good, but the food, the drinks, the service and the clientele leave much to be desired. Cannot believe this place is still open. The main bar is horrible. At times some of them bar maids forget that you paid for a drink and want you to pay again. The drinks are watered down and expensive. The fish sammich remind me of fish sticks in a hoagie roll. The cheesesteaks are good. The back bar seems to provide better service and for some reason the drinks in the back bar are cheaper. Parking is crazy. We had to park in the Wendy\'s parking lot. Luckily we didn\'t get towed. I guess since they got radio commercials they jacked the price up of everything. Worst service in the world. Our server had to be called several times, and still didn\'t take our first drink order until almost an hour after we arrived. It then took another hour to get a second drink. She forgot about the one appetizer we ordered, and asked if she could cancel it before we asked to pay the bill. Are you kidding? I would\'ve tried actual food but waiting another hour or two wasn\'t worth it. And the audacity to include gratuity, apologize without offering anything....no. We had to flag her down so many times and she STILL ignored our table. We only ordered drinks, nothing that would require that much time to make. I have never been so frustrated at a restaurant. Save yourself the aggravation. Chuck\'s has one of the best cheesesteaks I have ever eaten. I estimate that I have been over 30 places within Philly that sells cheesesteaks. In fact it is #1 on my list slightly before John\'s Roast Pork in South Philly.\n\nAnyway, I visited this place for the second time during lunch. My coworker and I arrived for lunch around 11:45 am. After we ate, we sat momentarily digesting our food when a call came on my cell phone. It was approximately 12:15 pm. Then suddenly, without warning, I hear very loud music playing from the jukebox. I found this to be extremely distracting, rude, discourteous, especially when people are trying to relax and enjoy their lunch. \n\nI\'m sure the staff can find other ways to entertain themselves. The staff should have at least asked the patrons if they would like to hear loud music while they are enjoying lunch. I find it hard to find individuals and businesses in Philly who conduct themselves with class. \n\nVery poor experience although they sell excellent cheesesteaks and fries. Next time I return (if I do), I will have to politely ask that if there is music played, that it be played at a reasonable volume or not played at all. If they stammer or refuse, I will leave and never return. I still can\'t believe that the restaurant and its staff would be so stupid as to think it\'s appropriate to blast music during lunch. Stay classy Philly! Overall seafood is pretty good. I\'ve had better and I\'ve had worse. Drinks are good avg price is about $9. I believe the prices are avg for a seafood place This place is really going down!!!!... I was approached by a snotty nose bartender!!!! He was very nonsocial. I ordered the drink special listed on the board and he tells me that it was yesterday\'s special..."why the hell is it still on the board today!!!!" SMH. Ok so I just told him let me decide. The waitress came and told us she\'ll get to her in a minute. Why a minute, it\'s only 4 customers in the whole bar/restaurant. But whatever she came right back. She noticeably didn\'t know the menu well. We ordered... 20 minutes later she told us that they didn\'t have the shrimp I ordered. Why did it take her about 20 minutes to tell us that in an empty restaurant. I\'m so done. I left!! This place needs to close down. On 8/3/2009, Heather L M. reviewed Chuck\'s Alibi and addressed several issues. The lack of sufficient air conditioning, the time it took the waitress to greet them, not a single bourbon behind the bar, no wet nap and an itty bitty lemon wedge. And although it appears that Heather likes Johnny Cash, the music was LOUD! \n\nTwo weeks later, on 8/17/209, Heather says that seemingly all of the previous issues had been magically addressed. She\'s not sure if she was extra hungry but says the crabs were extra good! Well maybe they were fresh that day or maybe Chuck\'s was just having a good day, (which are few) but there is no magic here! It\'s been four years now since your last review and I can assure you that this is still a two-star aquarium and is still sliding downhill! I loved it the food was hot and didn\'t take long..there service was great I went for dinner in Sunday and got the crab legs and shrimp and was impressed...it\'s definitely a hidden treasure Yelp is a FRAUD!  They were selling a  coupon $30 for $15 for Chucks n Chucks does not honor it.  Also, Yelp customer service does not return emails or calls!! THIS SITE IS FRAUD!!! I Consider myself to be a moderate restaurant patron.  I never  in my life came across an establishment that completely failed in all aspects of the dining experience.  We were a party of three seeking a late lunch.  One ordered a fish sandwich.  One ordered a half cheese steak.  And I  ordered a half of the special Italian sub.  The fish sandwich was served after 30 minutes and and came as the fish  dinner.  The dinner was 9 .99 the sandwich was 5.99.  The fish was overcooked complete with filet bones.  It s smelled awful.  After 45 minutes and only after several inquiries the cheese steak showed up as a whole sandwich with barley any cheese no peppers as ordered.  We informed them several times that we were going to be late for my mother\'s appointment at the fox chase cancer center.  At 60 minutes\nThey are trying to bill us and I was never provided my Italian Sub.  The Manager, Chris,  offered no courtesy discounts even for the Sandwich not served.  By pass this place.  There are many fine restaurants in this area.  Even the worse fast food would be better all around then this place. The drinks are decent. Better than a chain restaurant,  I have not been to a typical bar to compare them to. \n\nSeafood is really good, but I like to watch my salt intake so I often tell them "light" on whatever it is. I usually have salmon.  I think they are a bit heavy handed om the seasoning if left unchecked. \n\nThey are a bit pricey for a neighborhood bar. I haven\'t had a BAD experience tho.\n\nThe cheesesteak is awesome.  Even the smallest size is not suited for once person,  maybe a very hungry man. Love the crab cakes and fries. Try the peach Long Island iced tea it\'s a Winner sit at the bar to avoid the gratuity fee Never again!! Food, Service, Staff, Bathroom, Drinks Sucks! How is this place still open? Where to begin? After sitting down at our first table; we opted to move to another due to the sticky substance all over the surface. After ordering and waiting for nearly 30 minutes for our food to arrive we dug into our meals with our PLASTIC silverware. The food was terrible. I\'m pretty sure that the hamburgers were frozen patties. It was only after making it halfway through our dinner that we noticed the parade of ants marching along the half wall next to our booth. At that point we decided to cut out losses; which proved to be more difficult than you would imagine. Our waitress (the only one working) was nowhere to be found. It took another 20 minutes to locate her and cash out. I think I can safely say that Chuck\'s Alibi is off of my list of dining options. I visited here last week and everything was perfect.  They still serve excellent cheese steaks and I was afforded great service.  I have recommended this establishment as a potential site for my work\'s Christmas party. They have great service I like that they add the tip to the bill even though some people don\'t because u can\'t give them what you think they deserve but I use to be a server and that\'s gone with me but I had crabs and chicken cheese steak. The crabs was not fresh the meat was so mushy and my sister said her cheese steak was overly salty. So I give a two Watch the cook make your cheesesteak while pounding beer. Chucks fills that greasy Philly craving all night long. The kitchen will stuff you with greasy bar grub that asks you to betray your diet but if it\'s Friday night, go hard. The menu is balanced by grilled salmon, crab legs, roast beef options. The staff was genuine and focused. The music was straightforward, not too loud or inaudible. Great food poor service I mean workers attitude I was eater manager flew out the kitchen screaming at a worker I changed my mind from applying there\'s lol a lil pricy drinks definitely pricey great clean atmosphere besides some workers One and Done! \n\nWe were looking for a place to hold our "girls night out". It won\'t be this place! The highlight of my dining experience was the waitress (a delightful young lady that could do a whole lot better in a more desirable establishment) and the bread. \n\nWith that said there were several issues to name: \n1) I\'ve never been to a restaurant where the table is set with a plastic place setting.\n\n2) Unappetizing appetizer (muscles with the beard still in some) served with plastic plates to eat from.\n\n3) Shrimp scampi over seasoned with lemon and over cooked shrimp. The Fried shrimp was huge but it was not seasoned and the crab plate had unidentifiable seasonings with a hard baked potato. \nThe manager did take the price of my food off but by then the damage was done. \n\n4) The distraction of the staff (namely the manager and the "chef") walking around the entire time we were there. I can\'t recall the last time; I\'ve seen kitchen staff that needed to be in the front so much. \n\nOverall the server was great but the service was horrible. By the time we left we advised the young lady to get another job in a better establishment. She could do a whole lot better and make way more tips than in this place. This place sucks. The food is average at best, and the service is lousy. Want to eat a seafood dinner with plastic utensils? Go ahead, enjoy. Do you want to listen to unbearably loud hip hop music while you eat? Enjoy that, too.\n\nThis was our second time at Chuck\'s and it was actually worse than our first visit. We went to meet some friends who were going to be there watching the Flyers game. I had heard from friends that the cheesesteaks were good, so I decided to try one.\n\nI ordered a mushroom cheesesteak, and instead I got a chicken cheesesteak. Ok, one screw up is an honest mistake, but when the waitress brought out the second steak, it had no cheese on it. How can you have CHEESESTEAK without any cheese? On the third attempt, she finally got my order right, but the sandwich was average at best. The meat was dry and the mushrooms looked like they came out of a can. It was edible, but I will definitely NOT be going there for another cheesesteak. \n\nMy girl ordered mussels. The first time they came out, they were literally smothered in garlic. It was overpowering, and not in a good way. We both LIKE garlic, but this was inedible. You couldn\'t taste the mussels at all. \n\nWe sent it back, and the waitress brought another order of mussels in 5 minutes. My girl and I were both a little suspicious that they just scraped off the garlic and brought out the same dish, but the waitress said no, they gave us another customer\'s order. \n\nWe still couldn\'t figure out what she meant, but we thought that maybe someone had ordered the first dish with extra garlic and it found it\'s way to our table by mistake. No, the waitress said that was how they normally fix them. Huh? \n\nWhile it only took 5 minutes to replace the mussels, it took three times longer to get me another cheesesteak, and just as long to get the third one after the second one was messed up, too. \n\nBy the way, while the substandard food was replaced, no one offered to adjust the check, and the bartender (we were eating at the bar) still wanted me to pay $2 every time she refilled my diet coke. Considering the circumstances, I told her we should at least get free refills on our soft drinks for the rest of the evening. A few ounces of soda seem like a small price to keep a customer happy after you\'ve made three separate mistakes on the food. She said she would have to ask the manager, and after doing so, she did refill our soft drinks for free the rest of the evening. \n\nThe shame of it is, the mussels, when they weren\'t drowning in garlic, were actually quite tasty. But I see no reason to go back again after the repeated mistakes, and the other things (plastic silverware, much too loud music, and zero interest on the part of management (until I ASKED for a concession on the drinks, that is). Chuck\'s is within walking distance from my house, but I will be getting in the car and driving somewhere else the next time I want to have a decent dinner. It has great seafood and music. The crabs were good as usual. The sweet chili wings were excellent. Only bad thing is they only have one crab cracker for the whole restaurant.  Their mixed drinks are good and not watered down. Good food, terrible service. Expect to wait longer to order than it takes to order your food. Came today sat at the bar 15mins before being helped and it wasn\'t even crowded. Then was told I had to wait for the food server who was busy chatting... so I left empty handed. Same problem I had before but at least I left with food in hand. Won\'t be back again! Its kinda crazy. I\'ve passed by Chuck\'s a bunch of times, and always thought to myself, whenever we feel like going out for dinner, but can never decide where, let\'s try this place.  I\'m not so sure I\'m glad we did.\n\nWe arrived on a Friday night, where parking was completely concealed.  They mention on their menus that they have a free valet service, to which would have been helpful, considering we parked a couple blocks away.  Speaking of parking, the homes surrounding Chuck\'s must not appreciate their business, as while we were walking to our car, I could hear two urban hillbillies complaining about how we took up two spots in front of their house.\n\nSo, we actually get into Chuck\'s, and we approach a friendly guy and tell him we\'d like a table.  He responds by saying \'You can sit anywhere you want, anywhere that\'s available\', which is kinda confusing, and leaves you staring people down who have their disheveled napkins on the their plates in front of them.  It was a busy Friday night with the music being played hard.  \n\nIts busy, and I get that our waitress is a bit stressed, so I\'m not going to knock the service.  She was nice and friendly and did the bare essentials.  \n\nHad I known that this was a primarily a seafood joint, I don\'t think I would have gone, but it certainly wasn\'t a disappointment for my wife.  I ordered Chuck\'s Famous Alibi burger and she had the butterfly shrimp.\n\nThe burger was okay, nothing fabulous or famous about it, and priced decently, I suppose, at about 6.95.  The shrimp, however, were not as colossal as promised, and at 13.95 for 6, seemed to be a bit high.  I was completely floored when we were charged 8.00 for my wife\'s rum and coke.  \n\nAfter all, I don\'t think I\'ll be back to Chuck\'s, and I\'m kinda sorry that we went there in the first place.  I usually like to patronize mom and pop shops in and around my neighborhood, however, Chuck\'s is one alibi, I won\'t be using. The service at this place is the absolute worst. That is unfortunate because the food is pretty good and reasonably priced, but it isn\'t worth dealing with the rude and inattentive people who work there to get it.  I advise you to save your money and avoid this place. This is a virtual 5 star review, but in reality I\'m only giving it 3 until it works out the kinks. \n\nTHE GOOD: The Dungeness Crabs! A full D. Crab close to 2lbs (last night) that left me STUFFED to this morning. My girlfriend and I have talked about it 3 times since getting up! At only $14.00 it was a steal! I\'ll also say everyone else\'s food looked damn good too.\n\nAlso the service. It did take a bit to get our waitress, but once the ball was rolling everything was great. They gave me a free beer to apologize for the long wait (in actuality it was probably to make up for them bringing me the wrong beer in the first place, whatev...) AND offered to get us new hot fires half way through our meal! Who does that? \n\nTHE BAD: TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC DOWN!!!!! This place is a pub (well more on that in a sec.) but they have a ton of food business and even a steak shop, that was hopping late into the night, attached. BUT THEY WERE BLARING THE MUSIC LIKE IT WAS SOME SOUTH ST. MEAT MARKET! I can\'t stress enough, it wasn\'t just loud, but insanely loud! Everyone was having to yell at each other and read lips, including servers to customers. We complained and for a hot minute the guy turned it down, but 20 minutes later his jam came on and up it went. Also, the A/C seemed to be an issue with definite pockets of oven like heat zones that are battled by near arctic blasts over other areas, namely our table. As best as I could tell the music and a/c are not evenly dispersed throughout the place so one area is hot and quiet and the other is cold and loud, no middle ground. This will not stop me from going back, the crabs where that good. \n\nTHE UGLY: The bar is set up jenky. I don\'t mean the physical bar, that\'s fine with lots ( I mean LOTS) of flat screens everywhere. But the liquor they carry is odd. Some top shelf brands of one thing, then rock gut brands of another. They only offer Bud, Bud Lt. Miller Lite, and Yuengling on tap (and had tapped the wrong keg for the Yuengling and I got one of the two Lites to start) So go with bottled, it\'ll be colder too. \n\nIn short, the problems are minor and will probably be smoothed out in time. The upside is huge, with great food and good people...There is a new star in this often neglected corner of the NE, and that\'s a huge plus! When we walked in, my initial thought was - this was a winner.  Not only did they serve Dungeness crabs, but Johnny Cash was pumping through the place!  But then little problems began to surface:\n\n- For starters, there were definite temperature issues.  It was hot outside and the air conditioning was having trouble keeping the place consistently cooled.  \n- The waitress took a while to greet us though once she finally did, she was attentive and sweet.  \n- The music was LOUD.  The mix was great but the bass was bumpin so hard I felt like I was eating in a nightclub.  Not appropriate for a restaurant/neighborhood bar.\n- NO BOURBON!  Not a single bourbon behind the bar. \n\nBut the food was awesome and as far as I\'m concerned, that\'s what really matters.  The crabs were perfectly cooked and they served more than I could eat - for only $13.95!  And the side of fries was massive and perfectly cooked as well.  My only issue with the food was they did not provide a wet nap for clean up, just an itty bitty lemon wedge which was pretty much useless.\n\nSince they have only been open for a week or two, I have high hope that things will improve and this will become a 5 star spot! The food is great. Service is horrible. If you order on the phone they leave you on hold forever and never return. They keep you waiting sooo long when you order to the point that you may think they forgot. The most disgusting thing is there was a roach crawling up my chair the last time I dined in and I have never been back! Slowest service in Philadelphia. Also they can\'t get an order right. The food isn\'t bad though. I am only giving 1 star because there is not a negative star option! I went with 3 other friends. I was in town visiting from Atlanta and wanted some crab legs. First,  the parking is horrible. It\'s a little lot behind the building and you just have to pray that nothing happens to your car. We go on in and end up seating ourselves. It\'s a Tuesday night so it doesn\'t seem to be that busy. Our waitress took forever to come over to us to take our order. It took us 15 minutes for our sodas to come. Well over 45 minutes for our food to come out. Finally when the food came out only 2 dishes came out. Or other 2 guests had to wait about another 10 minutes for their food and they were missing items off their platters. My crab legs were actually delicious...I don\'t know if it\'s because I was super hungry or what,  but my friends were very disappointed with their food. Their seafood platters were fried... No seasoning whatsoever. The waitress barely came over to check on us... At this point with the service...I had figured since gratuity is included in all checks over $50 why would she give good service. Her ass is guaranteed a tip regardless. We finish up our meals I asked for a separate check for my food (only because I had ordered additional food to go for my friend who wasn\'t able to make it). I was then told we couldn\'t separate checks when you sit in the dining room. I don\'t know if the server was making it up as she went because she didn\'t feel like separating the check.  No where on the menu did it not say you can\'t separate checks. The check was given to us... $160... are you kidding me??? She charged us for every soda refill... Didn\'t even give any kind of discount for the horrible service or for the 2 other friends in the party who were missing part of their platter. It\'s cool... We will pay and she WILL NOT get any additional tip out. \n\nIt\'s really sad when you go out to eat to local establishments instead of these franchise restaurants and you have to regret supporting the local guy. The owner of this place really needs to re evaluate the nickel and diming policy and his wait staff. I am a server back home so it\'s very easy for me to tip more especially when good service is provided. I come home to Philly about 2 times a year sometimes more and I really look forward to checking out new places to eat and supporting small business. This establishment...I WILL NOT BE BACK... Nor would I recommend anyone to this place. Out of 4 entrees... Mine should not be the only one that was good. \n\nI don\'t know what this review will actually do for this business or even if the owner cares about this review. They look like they have been in business for a while,  but it\'s very unfortunate patrons don\'t know any better and it\'s become the norm and so common and acceptable for bad service at an establishment. I work very hard for my money and I don\'t mind spending it... But this establishment should somehow be held accountable and know that the people they hire from front of the house to back of the house should give consistent good service and good food. The purpose of people meeting up with friends and going out to eat is to have a good time. The highlight of the night should not be how awful of a time they had from service to food. Smh. It seemed like the bartenders made their own prices we spent $90 within the half-hour 2 Long Island Iced Teas that were $10 a piece and four shots $20 to get in for a comedy show that was horrible drinks of water down majorly prices are just ridiculous Second time eating here tried to give it another chance. Arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night I ate around 8:30 my girlfriend that came with me didn\'t get served untill 9:00 pm and decided to take it home since I was finished mgt. was not not appalled by what happened offered 10percent off a ruined birthday dinner. Thanks but know thanks. Last time here. Oh he also offered free second round of drinks. I gotta drive all the way back to Lansdowne. Again no thanks. ( Bad business Made the mistake to go back again.... why!!! The bar service was just horrible. Ordered my first drink and had to call the bartender over to request another drink. Finally I wanted a glass of water and didn\'t see the bartender; it\'s appears she\'s on the other side behind the pillar eating a bowl of cereal. Granted it\'s lunch time and it\'s only 5 ppl at the bar but at least make sure all guests are cool before you pour the milk. I decided to set my timer and just wait to see if she will tend to me. Nope!!! She did finish her cereal and then looked at her phone for a while before looking up. I called the waitress over to request a manager. I kept the timer running and decided to stop it when the manager came.  Another messed up lunch date trying to give Chucks another chance. SMH. I took a pic of the timer and the horrible bartender!!! Food was good, but i had to wait over 30 minutes just to receive my bill as my waitress was hiding in a little corner playing on her phone. It was quite interesting that she checked on every table but mines. Highly upset that gratuity was included because she didnt deserve not one cent. The experience counts for half of the visit so all in all I would rather just go to the seafood restaurant 5 minutes away. Can I give zero stars? An hour and 30 mins before we received food. After inquiring on food, the waitress said they where busy, but there where maybe 5 tables occupied or less. It\'s a waist of time. The meal was affordable. Inside looked nice, but the food was not worth the wait at all. I went there when they first open, food was good and at reasonable prices. Maybe the 3rd time I was there, I wasn\'t sure if they were short on staff but it took them 30minutes to get to us.  Of course, we decided to leave after waiting so long; after that time the place just totally turned me off and I haven\'t gone there since.\n\nEat in: awful\nBar: Good\nFood: Delicious\nArea: Not bad, a lot of traffic since it\'s right in intersection\nI like the place, just hope you don\'t pick a rotten day to go where the staff is lounging around haha. I came here on a Friday night and first of all I was asked for ID, which wasn\'t bad, but my male friend was frisked at the door so that made me wonder. Then looking for a seat is the worst! The waitresses/bartenders were not attentive to our table once we found one. We had to basically clean the table off ourselves and wait over 30 minutes just to order drinks and then had to ask for the menu. Limited menu with crazy expensive prices for seafood that did not look fresh to me. I ordered Coronas. How could you mess that up? Never going back to that ratchet ass bar with women wearing scarves on their heads like they were going to bed? Not my style or on my level at all. So I\'ve been here about 5 or 6 times now and have always had a good time.\n\nThere\'s two separate areas with two different bars and menus, the takeout area and the main area. The takeout area is good for a quick cheesesteak during the day and the main area at night has a nice, fuller menu. Lately, Chuck\'s Alibi has been my go-to cheesesteak spot.\n\nAnd seafood is booooomb. It\'s smells so good and the taste does not disappoint! \n\nThey had Karaoke night the last time I went (it was a Tuesday). My people.  Always check your bill because I always find that the restaurants that have a predominately black clientele always have some questionable fees.  First, there was a beverage tax on top of a sales tax.  Second, there was a service charge.  I assumed that was a slick way of charging a tip, so therefore I did not give anything extra.  I also did not like the way the waitress was rushing me to pay my bill.  We were not in a rush and I was still eating.  The positive side was that the food was good even though they did not have calamari, which is quite disturbing. I ordered 3 cheesesteaks and fries over the phone for pick up. The person taking my order was rude and unprofessional. After I picked up my order and pulled off, I realized that they did not put my fries in the bag. I went back to get my fries and did not even receive an apology for the mix up. When I arrived home, I had 3 chicken cheesesteaks instead of beef. When I called to let them know, the girl who answered just rambled on about how she didn\'t take my order so she didnt know it was wrong. Still no apology for the mistake, just a bunch of excuses. Unfortunately this is not the first time I had a bad experience with this restaurant and I will not be returning. Don\'t think I\'ve ever had over cooked mussels but some how they managed to accomplish that.  Every dish was over cooked or straight up burnt and half of the food on the plate was cold as if they let it sit around until the last item was ready. The surf and turf ..shrimp was hard over cooked and over breaded and there were only 4 shrimp.  Most place give you 6 and the turf  lived up to the name as the steak was as hard and tasteless as a piece of artificial turf and the asparagus was completely bland..nothing on them..not even the basics like salt,butter, grill marks..nothing.looked like it was defrosted and then put on the plate.  Also they use this weird oil on the crab legs..not sure what it is but it\'s not butter and it smells and taste weird. Very cheap ingredients but the prices are the same if not more than a nice place with silverware instead of plastic forks.  Spent over 100 dollars on some crap we couldn\'t eat and ended up giving it to the dog and even he was looking at it crossed eyed. And what\'s with the tip included already crap?  Very disappointing to spend this much money on a rare night out and still hungry cause the food was too gross to finish. We ended up here because every other place in the area was packed. 1st and last time that we will step foot in this whole in the wall. A few suggestions ..1. Fire the cook immediately...ban him or her from ever cooking again for anyone, not even themselves! 2. Turn the dang music down..this is not a club with dancing so why is the music bumping like a dance battle is about to pop off? 3. Fix those raggedy behind tables!! What the...!?!? The table was rocking like the last supper on the titanic ..ridiculous! And you have the nerve to charge prices like a real quality restaurant . 4. Call Robert Irvine with restaurant impossible A.S.A.P. and get a whole over haul done cause to charge people that much and not deliver a solid product is a scam. We feel like we\'ve been hustled..just forked over our hard earned money for something even the dog was sketchy about eating and he\'ll eat deer poop if you let him. (Sad but true..he\'s greedy) Even the sprite was nasty..never again. This should be a negative star review but its not allowed....one star is being WAY too generous! Crooks! I want my money back! My sister, Aunt and I went to this place and had a semi great time, but that was only because of the company. The food was great too actually. Our only issue was the waitress, who just so happened to be the worst waitress we have all ever came in contact with. For starters, my Aunt and I both ordered chicken parm sandwiches, Long Island iced tea, I ordered fried shrimp to go and my sister, who also had a Long Island ice tea, ordered a fish hoagie. The teas came out first of course and were great, but too strong for me, for I am not a heavy drinker, and we found out later that instead of asking, she just gave us top shelf alcohol instead of the cheaper $9 bottom shelf. Which was fine. I suppose we should\'ve read the menu prior to ordering. Once the food started coming out, we realized that she put the order in as chicken parm with spaghetti. Granted it was loud in there so she might not have heard us, but her attitude once we told her about the issue was that of a spoiled toddler. She sucked her teeth and rolled her eyes and says " well it is loud in here."  Needless to say, we were shocked, but we let go. They put our chicken on bread and brought it back to us. Then out comes my fried to go shrimp in a plate. So I just said, " No ma\'am it was supposed to be to go." With another roll of the eyes, she was off to put my shrimp in a box. The end of our time was finally here. We asked for the bill, and they charged us a gratuity tax that only went on my check. That too was fine, because at this point I was ready to go. I put a zero in the tip location and signed the paper. THE NEXT DAY I FOUND OUT THAT MY ACCOUNT WAS ON HOLD BECAUSE FRAUD. She had went back into my account and attempted to give herself an EXTRA $20 tip. My bank stopped the charge and I called chucks only to be met by another ruddy who told me that the manger wasn\'t in. I left my name and number and spoke a little of the issue, and I never received a call back. FYI go to the ATM before going to this place!!!!! Took forever for the bar maid to acknowledge me and my friend. She was focused on watching the tv and playing in her hair.  It wasn\'t even crowded at the bar - six people at the bar. I finally came here after my friends ranted and raved about this place. It took 30 minutes for someone to come take my food order. I ordered calamari and it took 25 minutes to get to me. When they arrived, they looked like bloated Cheerios that had been over fried. I\'m good on this place. Not worth the hype... Save your money! This place is just disrespectful! $33.00 for overcooked chewy fried shrimp that came with fries saturated in grease! It\'s just not worth it! They deserve 0 stars! Never will I ever spend another cent here! Ordered food before 9pm through GrubHub for pickup. We sat in the lot until we got confirmation through the app that it was done at 9:27p. All we had was a crabcake platter with fries, a chicken sandwich, a salad and some buffalo shrimp.  Nothing major! My husband goes in to grab the food only to find out it wasn\'t ready and there was only 1 person working the kitchen. To make a long story short, we never got our food until 11:15p, and by that time we didn\'t even want it. Food wasn\'t that good and looked like it was just thrown together. And we had to have them fix our order because some of the things we requested weren\'t there. I get that we\'re currently working under different and difficult circumstances, but why even remain open or commit to taking so many orders that can\'t be fulfilled in a timely manner?? My husband said there was a person in there waiting to pick up some peel shrimp before he even got there, and this person was just receiving her order when we got ours! I\'ll never order from here again, nor would I recommend!! 6/28/12\nhmmmm\niced tea= gold peak\nparking is pretty much non-existent so this location must get foot traffic 99.9% of the time.\nmusic is very loud for lunch time.  Thankfully they shut it off.\nA solid .5 star.  I knew it wasn\'t a good sign when the tea wasn\'t freshly brewed although the  waitress said it was.  I know Gold Peak when I taste it.\n\nService was pathetically slow. The server was pissed off about something and  couldn\'t get herself together for us or the 3 unlucky young men who arrived as we finished.\n\nFood is fresh but overall meh-nothing to write home or to the next patron about.  Clean bathroom.  \nThat was the wierdest crabcake I have ever tasted.  Fried like a hush puppy.  No filler but it wasn\'t bluecrab either.  The server said it was lump; it was shredded and tasted like straight-from-the-ocean seaweed.\n\nI DIDNT TAKE MY LEFTOVERS SO THAT SAYS IT ALL.  Anyway enough said.  Next. I was looking forward to hanging out with my friend but then I found out it was a bar. I was somewhat reluctant because I generally don\'t go to bars. It just isn\'t my thing. Then I learned it was a bar restaurant that was somewhat of an old school atmosphere no drama, good food, and decent music. \n\nI walked in looking around trying to get a sense of the atmosphere. Immediately we were informed that a Septa Group was having a fish fry and go ahead back. Of course we declined and say at the bar. There seemed to be bartender for everything, greeting, another for drinks, one to handle food, another to check you and remove your dirty dishes and empties. I initially looked at it as really cool but then as the night went on I began to not like it. I will explain why shortly. I was told the mussels were to die for. Well let\'s just I died for a feed minutes after my King Edward Mussels came. This was a yumful moment. Juicey, sweet (not sugary) but slightly firm in fresh garlic, parsley, buttery sauce that I wanted to drink. I didn\'t drink it but considered it. Then I dove into my buffalo shrimp. OMG! Theses little "fishies" went we-we-we all the way home to my tummy. A side of blue cheese was provided. Every was this crisp y outside with perfectly cooked shrimp. I was so pleasantly surprised by how delish this food was prepared, plated and served. This place to look at it is a typical bar not fancy at all. The musics rotated skipping from the 60\'s put to present day. People were laughing , drinking and eating and every now again someone would feel the music and dance a little. It is a chilled atmosphere and overall layer back. This was what I needed chilled with good food and good service. \n\nThe drink bartender gave my friends and I a sample of this frozen drink that was sitting on the counter. I ordered one and it was like a strawberry fruity daiquiri. It was so enjoyable.\n\nThe bill came and it at a service charge, tax, food charge. I trough it was my entire bill. Nope! It was only for the food. Then before leaving we realized the bill didn\'t mention the drinks. I asked because I didn\'t want any drama being that I wasn\'t a local. That is when I was told $10. I laughed because the bartender laughed but this man was serious. In my mind I was puzzled because the cost was similar to the cost of a few higher end places that I have been. After I got over blinking rapidly I paid him and tipped. This was supposed to be my frugal night, keeping my cost under $25. Not here I spent almost $50 between the food drinks and two bartenders. I wish the bartender had told me the cost of the frozen drink and informed me of the drink specials that were $3 and $6. The bartender who handled my food took my money to cover my food. When she returned with my change it was short $.30. I asked her what happened to the rest of my change. She told me Oh! You want that? I said, "Uh yeah." She paused and looked at me as if I was being unreasonable and then said "well I didn\'t have any change". She then pulls out 2 quarters and gives it to me. What nerve to make an assumption like that. If she keeps the change from other customers all night who knows how much she can make above and beyond her hourly rate and actual tips earned. That was stealing, in poor taste, and unethical. I gave back a quarter because it was about the principle of the matter. That type of waiter can be bad for business. The Devil himself must be cooking at Chuck\'s as the Dangerous Deviled Crabs are proof! Don\'t count on getting what you ordered either. That\'s a 50/50 chance. But you can count on a long wait. Everything is served on paper plates with paper napkins and plastic utensils. No table cloths either. It\'s just like eating at Wendy\'s but a lot more expensive. I think the city health inspectors are even afraid of this joint! Seafood house? This place is more like MEET JAWS! And be sure to bring a pair of ear plugs as the volume of the rap music is very, very L-O-U-D! Enjoy! Really bad experience. Long Island was mostly ice, party of 6 had to wait 45 mins for cold food. Cheese steaks cold, Alfredo cold, my scampi was extremely watered down, whiting was just a frozen filet deep fried with no flavoring. We just paid for the drinks and on our way to TGIFridsys. Never again. The fool was horrible the ribs taste like chewed up tires with barbecue sauce slept on top of it they must\'ve been in the freezer for a month then pulled out of the freezer threw them in the fryer and slap some sweet baby Ray\'s sauce on top of it I was so disappointed This is a local bar  restaurant nearby the food is usually really good but the drinks are off the hook. I would reccomend if you come her to try the fried shrimp and the crab legs they are the best!!! I also like how the bartender makes the mixed drinks they are always very flavorable. The price is a little expensive but it well worth the money i put out. I will come back again in the future. You should try it too.... After being a go-go bar during the mid to late 1960\'s (The Wedge), it became Chuck\'s Alibi. It was a great neighborhood place during its early years. But during the years since, it has had many names and many owners. (Chuck has maintained ownership of the buildings). After being closed up for a long period, the joint has reopened again as "Chuck\'s Alibi", but again this business has another new owner. The food seems to be overpriced, not very good at best, and is served on disposable plates with plastic utensils. (Just like Wendy\'s around the corner). And be prepared for a long wait! The drinks are good but the prices are rediculousley high! $8.00 for a rum and coke? This is not center city. This is a neighborhood bar, although very few neighborhood people come here anymore. The music is very, very loud and it is actually obnoxious. Too much Rap and Hip-Hop. The live music is gone. No parking to speak of. A little lot tucked away in the back. They claim to have valet parking although the night I was there they had just fired the attendant. And there is a huge turnover of employees. This joint is for you If you like public transportation, poor service, high prices, loud music and having dinner like your picnicing at the park. As for me, I would rather picnic at the park. It\'s quieter and cheaper! So I took my family out for my wife\'s birthday.  Every time we drove by this place we said we wanted to try it.  Needless to say I was not impressed.  Our waitress was great,  so service wasn\'t an issue.  The food was.  The place needs a major face lift.  It really could be a great place, but I\'m sorry I don\'t need to hear @ss up nose down playing while I\'m eating.  Over cooked burger,  dried out chicken parmesan no free refills, gratuity added after you hit $50, all equal taking my hard earned money elsewhere. bad food. bad service. bad atmosphere. the burgers are frozen shop rite burgers. they give you plastic utensils. they play rap.  awful. Terrible service , they renovated the place so it looks completely different. First of all it\'s cash only which is super weird. What kind of the establishment doesn\'t accept cards? I asked the waitress and she\'s like there\'s a machine but they only accept cash going on 4 months. The bartender didn\'t crack not one smile. They food waitress didn\'t come over to ask for our order.\nMy boyfriend had to go across the bar to get our order. I looked over and everyone was on their phone. Then , our food didn\'t come at the same time. My boyfriends food arrived cold so we sent it back and I had to wait extra 30 mins for mine. I would no recommend this place. They had a TON of security and they search you which is uncomfortable. Like I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone . Oh and not to mention our drinks were $48 for 2 drinks !!! You do the math. We stopped back this past weekend and it seems the previous issues were all magically addressed!  The music was much quieter and was more appropriate for dining, the temperature was consistently cool, and they served wet naps with the crabs!  \n\nAnd the crabs, I don\'t know if I was extra hungry but they were extra good!!  This place is definitely a winner. I have come to chucks alibi before but this has been the first time I have been here in a while. It was a cool experience, the restaurant wasn\'t packed and the vibes were chill. It did take a minute for us to be served at the bar. There weren\'t that many guest but the bartenders were taking their time. It took about 20minutes after we put a drink order in to put a food order in after that. When the food did arrive it was excellent. The teriyaki wings were top notch and the bbq not so much. The shrimp and salmon salad was extensive good down to the last bite. This was really the best part of the meal. Even though the bartenders were moving at a slow pace, they were friendly. The drinks weren\'t that strong to be honest and they had way too much ice in the cup. Overall my experience here was about 3.2 star  rating. I want to come on the day they have unlimited crabs . SO.....Chucks Alibi.....hmmmm.....\n\nOk, Chucks Alibi came up as a new option to head to for our friday lunch time. We were in the mood for seafood, and someone suggested we try here. So, quick jump on Yelp to see what my fellow Yelpers have to say about the place. *Price is Right Horn* 2 Stars? Yikes. But, I decide to dig deeper; and there seemed to be an often repeated phrase: "Crappy place, terrible service.....FOOD IS GREAT THOUGH." So I figured I\'d at least give Chucks Alibi a chance to set the record straight.\n\nFriday rolls around and we make the trek over to Five Points. NOW, Chucks has a TINY (and I mean TINY) private lot, but anytime other than midday, the parking here is probably a nightmare. Located at the intersection of Castor, Oxford and Rising Sun, there isn\'t much in the way of where to park your car. I\'m not sure how anyone going here at night manages. We were able to park in the lot, but again, it was midday on Friday. \n\nUpon walking in, I immediately saw how Chucks earned it\'s 2 star rating. The inside itself skews a bit toward "dilapidated." It\'s old. And not just in "behind the times," although it is that too, (there is a section of those half round velvet booths like Tony Montana sat in in Scarface). The inside seemed run down. Upon entering the dining area, there is a huge bar taking up almost the entire first floor, but there appears to be a dining area off to the side, and a split level situation next to that. We choose up, and headed to the aforementioned Scarface booth section. Along our way, we pass a man (maybe an employee?) fast asleep in one of the booths. Not a good look. \n\nWe choose to sit at a table rather than the velour mafia booths, and notice that the table is sticky. Gross. At this point, one of our four even says, "man....I don\'t want to eat here." It was at this point that I mentioned the reviews. "Good food, terrible everything else." So he relented and decided to at least try the food. Our waitress came over (very nice btw. We had no problems with SERVICE, except for a sneaky little caveat that I\'ll get to....), and handed us the menus. We order and wait for our food. A crabcake sandwich for me, buffalo cheese steak, chicken parm sandwich and 1 pound of Dungeness crabs for the others. The food comes out, and looks fine, so we dig in.\n\nFirst, there are no crab crackers here. That\'s insane. A place that sells crab legs doesn\'t have crab crackers! My friend pointed out, almost assuredly correctly, that they probably get stolen, so there\'s that. But still, if you come here for crab, either bring your own crackers, or get your hands nice and ready.\n\nThe crab cake sandwich was good; it wasn\'t jumbo lump, but it wasn\'t backfin, canned crab either. Decent. The buffalo chicken and parm sandwiches got, "actually, pretty good" descriptors. The crab was described as "delicious," so I guess there may be something to the reviews after all.\n\nNow, the sneaky caveat: Chucks Alibi ADDS GRATUITY TO THE TIP, no matter what. We wound up double tipping, as we didn\'t notice until we got back to the office. Ugh. \n\nI\'m giving Chucks Alibi 3 stars, as the food was good, and thats what matters MOST. The table being sticky is seriously concerning, but I didn\'t get the vibe that that place is DIRTY, just definitely indicative of its geographical location. We didn\'t try the drinks, but I hear they do that well as well. \n\nI\'d give them another shot. It\'s definitely someplace to go if you\'re not the pretentious type and just want some good food without all (or ANY really) of the fuss. Food is fucking nasty no seasoning Crab legs seem old.  I spent so much money on seafood and all of the food is awful never again will I order from them FIRE the Dam cook they clearly don\'t know what they are doing.   Food nasty just like the Heroin looking Waitresses. Chucks have went down Don\'t waste your time eating there. Had a wonderful time.The food was superb and our waitress was very professional,and quite attractive,I must say.\nThe food was cooked just right,and we even spoke with the cook,on our way back to the parking lot.\nIf you go,and have never been there,make certain you ask for the beverage,"The Ali Bomb",and make sure you drink the limited amount of two(2).\nBefore u drink though,please make sure that you have someone to drive you home.Yes,do not attempt to drive,after two of them.Now,this spot is really,cool and cozy in the winter time.Nice music,and just a place to chill,with your sidekick,sidechick,wifey,husband,or significant other.\nMake sure that you are hungry though,because the portion sizes are great.Remember again,"Ali Bomb". well as usual i returned to chucks evrything wasnt so great with my waitress she took to long to come to my table and when she did she greeted me with her name (ashley) and told me what the drink specials were after that she returned with my drink and took my food order she did not serve my food another employee did but that was fine the food was excellent but my waitress never returned to me.. i had to stop someone else and ask for napkins and still she didnt return it wasnt till i finshed my food and my drink was gone that she returned and asked if i would like another drink i said no and she gave me my check. i still do recommend chucks alibi but i sure enough know i will never recommend ashley as your waitress. I\'m one and done.  My husband and I went there since we heard about them on the radio and it was our anniversary and we just wanted to try someplace we had never been but going there was a mistake.  There were only a couple people in there since it was the holiday and it was still early so good start.  Since we had never been there before we didn\'t know that we should seat ourselves.  When we were greeted by the bartender but she walked away so we had to stop another worker passing by to ask if we had to be seated and were told we could sit anywhere.  We decided to sit in the upstairs area so we could look around the place.  The waiter came and gave us menus and asked if we wanted something to drink and I asked if he could give us a few minutes and he said OK. After too long of a wait  he came back my husband asked if he could wipe our table off since it was still messy from the last patrons.  He wiped it off but left it so wet that I had to use tissues from my purse to dry it up some.  I ordered a frozen drink and he ordered wine but as I watch from above the bartender takes the remainder of what was in the pitcher from my drink and puts it into two shot glasses and sits it in front of two other people who were there drinking and laughing with her.  I really feel that if I am paying for the drink and there is some left it should be given to me and not another patron.  If that\'s what she wanted to do it should have been out of the view of the customers.  I received the smallest piece of corn ever with my order and for that kind of money I feel that a little more care should be given in how a plate looks before it is served to the customer.  The only good thing about the visit was that the flavor of the food was very good and our server was nice but I think the staff needs more customer service training.  No talking and chit chatting when there are customers because too much time passes before the customer is thought about again. Not sure what happened with Chuck\'s over the years, but it went completely downhill. Decided to come here for a last minute happy hour with my husband, and talk about being completely ignored. We sat at the bar for a good 5 minutes without being acknowledged. I could see if it was packed but it was literally 2 other patrons and the rest were workers. My husband had to get a barmaids attention to ask if she\'s serving, but I guess that wasn\'t her area. Still no menu, so after another 3 minutes of no service we left. Never again will I attempt to give them my money. My husband and I went in one evening because we live close by and wanted drinks and a quick bite to eat.  Didn\'t even get that far, because the atmosphere there was just loud and weird, so we turned right around to look elsewhere.  Even if the food is great it felt like a loud, crowded, messy place and not particularly welcoming, that\'s all. Seafood here is awesome. Drinks are super expensive for a bar though. I believe they charge you extra after a certain time or only doubles after 6pm which is ridiculous. Service needs a pick-me-up because it really shouldn\'t take me flagging down the waitress for napkins to get attention when she had two tables. I come here when I\'m in the area. Not somewhere I\'m going out of my way to get to. I ordered my food, called to confirm, was told to come in for the food it would be ready in 10 minutes. I went to pick up the food and the staff were extremely unprofessional. I waited 2 hours to be told my order was given to someone else. When I asked how much longer it would take to have a new order placed, they stated they already  had to orders waiting. They attended to make no accommodations for their error and mistake. Definitely will not order for this place again.. Soo here\'s the truth about Chuck Alibi...\n\nThis is my neighborhood bar and I\'d say that this place is as versatile as it gets. You want a drink, a shot, good food, good music, random experiences Chucks can do it all. My TIP: Bring Cash\n\nNow here\'s some of the things that I struggle understanding. The turnover with the staff is insane. There\'s always new faces in there. No biggie just something I\'ve noticed. The other thing, is the service especially when it comes to ordering food is eh meh. Normally when I come here I\'m here to chill so I don\'t mind but could definitely improve.\n\nNOW HERES MY PET PEEVE.....There\'s a separate bill for food and drinks!! Wtf!! That\'s gets me every time! \n\nAll in all go to Chucks and have a great time. It\'s worth it the food there at chucks is amazing and the drinks are made just right. most of the waitresses give great service. the bartenders there also a plus good service as well... love the crabs and the mussels there and cheese steaks too a must have... i have been going there every weekend siince they reopened the place as chucks alibi...i recommed this place to alot of my family and friends... i went to chucks tonight the food was great as always my waitress was very attentive checking on us every so often she greeted us with her name (crystal) and asked what we would like to drink i had a baybreeze and my husband a beer.she came back with our drink in a timely manner and then took our food order.the food came out very fast i was happy i came out to chucks tonight and im definitley going back there for some crabs... Had the displeasure of going to this bar/restaurant last night. My date and I walked in to be greeted by....no one. There\'s a hostess stand but no host. A bar patron had to tell us it was self seating and good luck flagging down a waitress. Chucks doesn\'t look like a bad place just a tad dated however the rap and booty music loudly blaring throws off the ambiance. Our waitress took our drink order and then not even a minute later another came to do the same. When we told her our order had been taken and pointed out our server she sucked her teeth loudly and stormed off. My dates drink(Bloody Mary) was decent however my coke was served in a dirty glass. When I asked for a clean one I was given a dirty look and a new soda 5 minutes later in a Styrofoam cup with a lid. Our appetizer was served WITH our meal. The food was all sub par and I was given ranch dressing that was so old/spoiled that it was separating. We picked at our food, paid the bill and left where we almost got hit by a car coming out of the parking lot. If you\'re looking for somewhere to dance and drink this place is probably decent but for anyone else don\'t bother. I now understand why this place needs an alibi. I used to frequent this place approximately 5yrs ago.  Always a good time, Good food & even better service.  As of late, not so much! The food has been pretty consistent but the staff and service is poor and beyond unprofessional.  Most times U will find yourself stalking  the bartenders for a drink even when the bar isn\'t crowded; to be greeted with not so pleasant attitudes by not so pretty girls who can\'t make drinks.  I sent my Long Island back and the bartender asked me what\'s wrong with it?  I explain what was wrong with my drink and she says, i ran out of sour mix.  So u just gonna charge me 13$ for a glass of bs? I don\'t understand it.  I even had a server charge my card gratuity for takeout on top of taking my cash tip.  When confronted acted totally oblivious.  Check ur receipts cuz these ppl will rob you. I don\'t get it.  It\'s a big place in an incredible location but they definitely don\'t know what to do with it.  Plastic utensils? REALLY?!  So cheap. The food is okay but not worth the price.  Valet parking?  No, not even close.   The music is too loud too. Awful place. Went here with my friends and I had a horrible experience. I asked for a hookah menu and apparently it does not exist. The owner was very rude and unwelcoming. You have to pay $25 per 2 people and they only accept cash-_- I had a horrible experience!!!! If you want to hookah with friends, do not go to cleopatra cafe. Quiet, laid back relaxed atmosphere. Good owners and the place is very clean and provides decent service. It seems this place might have been good in the past but has recently been getting worse. I\'m not sure if they changed ownership or if the guy that owns it has just gotten tired of having the business but it is definitely not a place to have a good time which is what people intend on doing when they smoke a hookah. \nI read reviews on here before going and thought I would never visit this place until a friend of mine invited me.  I was hesitant but he talked me into coming by.  The reviews that speak of racism are correct. If your not white or Indian then definitely don\'t go here. \n(however I am a white woman and still was treated bad, perhaps becasue I came with a lady and not a man? who knows.)\n\nWhen we walked in the door they told us we had to order to stay but they wouldn\'t give us time to look at the menu. They stood over us and every 30 seconds were aggressively telling us that we had to decide on something or get out. We didn\'t order quick enough so they escorted us while yelling at us in their language and making rude gestures the entire way out. The owner continued to curse us as we crossed the street to leave in our car. Someone unknowingly, might think this was just a bad day. After reading others awful reviews it seems this is the norm. \n\nUnfortunate and disappointed I quite agree with most of the reviews posted here about the owner of this terrible place. I feel the owner is mentally ill or normally high on weed. He is a racist bastard and I will not be surprised if someone\'s sues to this place/owner in future.\n\nI don\'t want to go into the minute details about our conversation with the owner but I would suggest that you should only visit this place in case you are fine with being treated as shit.I would rather spend an extra $10 bucks and go to a better place with better customer service.\n\nI would have given 0 or less rating had yelp provided me that option. This is one of my new favorite hangout spots after dinner. I love when they play club music because then you just want to get up and dance like crazy! Along with hookah ($12), they also sell tea, coffee, cocktail, etc. This is the best hookah bar that I have found in Philadelphia. The only let down was that they didn\'t have my favorite flavor: rose. \n\nThey do, however have great prices on hookahs, Turkish coffee, smoothies, hot tea mmm....\n\nThe service was great (we never went without a hot coal), the hookah equipment was clean and looked nice and the atmosphere is great.\n\nI plan on going back. shittest hookah in americaaaaaaaaaa do not go it is ass. the guy is a asshole and they only take cash and it sucks so bad WORST HOOKAH BAR EVER!!!! If you have smoked good hookah you know this isn\'t it. Our hookah tasted burnt making us suspect that it was probably an old hookah where they add a little bit of fresh shisha. The staff is rude and don\'t try to help you if you tell them you have a problem. Instead they keep walking by you, look at you and ignore you as if they do not care. As a female, the staff hits on you and only assists you if you flirt with them. Been here a few times because it\'s open late, while hoping each experience would get better. Nope I was wrong! Disappointed for the LAST time! Awesome place; very hospitable hosts. A must visit. The place makes you miserable... The only good thing about it is the music. The prices make no sense and the owner is always feeling the need to introduce himself to his customers and to bother them. My friends and I certainly couldn\'t enjoy our stay here. This place is downright horrible. The service was probably some of the worst I\'ve ever received in my life.  My friends have posted on yelp before about our experience, but the owners of this low-life hookah joint deleted them to make themselves look better.\nDon\'t go here, that\'s all I can say.  I\'m not hard to please at restaurants and public places such as this, but when we were overcharged for no reason I do get upset.  The "waiter" refused to give us a receipt showing what exactly we were paying for which was completely unprofessional.  Even with the gratuity added on to our bill, we still paid an extra $20ish dollars for god knows what.  We were the only large group at the location since it was a Thursday night.  We continually ordered more hookahs and drinks so it was a slap in the face when they took hookahs aways from us before we were finished.  We even told them we weren\'t finished and they insisted the hookahs were empty when they weren\'t.  I would understand if they wanted us to leave because we were loud or obnoxious but we were talking at normal levels and weren\'t doing anything obnoxious.  I\'ll never be heading back to this place, that\'s for sure. I have never had such TERRIBLE SERVICE and been OVERCHARGED for it!\n\nI went to Cleopatra on a Thursday night with about 9 people for a friend\'s going away celebration. As soon as I got there the few people who were there before me told me that we had to have a hookah for every two people and that we weren\'t allowed to share. This seemed odd to me but we shared anyway.\n\nThe servers were very inattentive and rude when they did talk to us. We ended up getting 6 hookahs at the $12+tax charge plus $1 each for 2 extra coals. our night ended abruptly when not 15 minutes after getting our extra coals, the hookahs were taken from in front of us. I know my coal was still burning orange and there was still smoke pulling but the man told me they were done. I tried to tell him that we had literally JUST received the extra coals so he decided to shove the top of the hookah in my face saying that it was done, even as I pointed out the fact that it was still burning. After being treated badly all night we decided to leave at this point. We looked at the check and it said $98 without any breakdown of the charges. On top of the hookahs we ordered 2 $2 waters so our check should have been $78, or $83.46 with a 7% sales tax. When we tried to ask if they included tip the man said "no tip." I tried to argue against it but my friends ended up paying the extra money so we could just leave as quickly as possible.\n\nThe man even complained that we were at the table for a long time but there were empty tables all night.\n\nHands down WORST experience and I hope to never go back. I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The owner is incredibly rude and RACIST! Went in here on a Friday night. All of my friends and I are well over 18, yet the owner kept yelling at us (I mean literally screaming), trying to say that we were showing him fakes. Finally he sat us and got annoyed after my friend questioned if there was a menu we could look at, saying that we asked too many questions and if didn\'t like that there wasn\'t a menu we could leave. Well we gladly did, with this man following closely behind us and aggressively shoving my black male friend out the door. Please do NOT patronize this business. This is my favorite sheesha, hookah place in Philly.  The service is very quick.  Within a few minutes, they are there to take your order and a few minutes thereafter, your sheesha is brought to your table.  Coals are replaced pretty frequently and if you have an issue with a sheesha, just ask and they will fix it.  The hookahs are clean too.  They have a whole variety of flavors but I just stick to my rotation of Cherry-Mint and Watermelon-Mint.  Their mint tea is also fresh, piping hot and flavorful - its authentic mint tea.  They have cappuccino as well which is delicious.  No really diverse food or dessert offerings so plan to eat before or after!\n\nIts a small place but the tables are evenly spaced so you are not sitting on top of other people - perfect place to chill out, smoke a pipe and hang out with a group of friends.  Its dark inside and they have some disco lights set up, so dont expect a well lit area.  The music is played at a decent volume so its not too loud to have a conversation but not too quiet either - its either house or arabic pop music - nothing else in between.  \n\nIn reading the reviews, I noticed some people have challenges with the people that work there and owner.  I actually have a very different opinion.  The one big rule they have is a minimum of one hookah per two people.  Its a pretty simple rule and just makes sense for a small cafe in west philly to have in place - its like a minimum order menu.  If you follow the rules, they\'ll treat you like royalty!  Enjoy the smoke! Here is the deal, I\'ve been a regular customer since the time these guys opened up shop which was almost a year ago. I am a hookah fanatic, and their hookah is the best in Philly, hands down. \n\nBut here is the deal, your experience at the place will depend on the mood of this guy, I think his name is Adil or something. When they first opened, it was Adil and Mahamoud. While Mahamoud was around, I had the best customer experience. But the day Mahamoud stopped working there, I\'ve had the worst time. \n\nAdil will hit on the women (especially if you are two or more women in the group), and will treat the men like shit. If you do not look like you\'re from Saudi, and if you are male, you can only pray that Adil will be in a good mood to treat you like a human being. The later you come to this joint aka after midnight or 1am, the higher your chances are of being treated like crap. He is very very visibly on coke or extremely high, and will often get aggressive with the guys for no reason. \n\nKeep in mind, I\'ve been coming here for over a year, and this has happened atleast 5-6 times with me, and I\'ve seen it countless times with other customers. I have no idea why I chose to ignore it so long. Maybe because their hookah is so good, and I often came in with only a male friend. But whenever I brought other girl friends or a group of mixed gendered people, this ALWAYS happened. It varied in terms of severity. But now I am so embarrassed to recommend this place to any of my friends anymore. \n\nI think the time is approaching when they will be sued. The place has pissed off a lot of people.  And btw, I saw a lot of negative reviews a couple of weeks ago about this place, but somehow, very mysteriously, all of them have disappeared. I dont know whats going on here. Meh! The place is great, the price is cool and the are always in top with the coal issue without charging you every time. They only flaw this place has is that its BYOB but you have to pay $25 to do so ... Wtf right? You also can not have any food! \\  I get the food part but hookah + drinks = a good time. How can you claim to be BYOB and then charge me $25 to bring in liquor? Idk but that was a big set back for me. I shall not return. I really liked this place at first, considering it was\n1) open very late, till about 3 am\n2) ridiculously cheap at $10 for a hookah (can\'t find that ANYWHERE in Philly) \n3) playing my favorite Arabic music as we smoked\n\nHowever, I got completely turned off by this place when dealing with the owner, who is an extremely racist, sexist, and entirely awful person. He tried to over-charge us every time we went, rushed us out of the cafe so he could smoke with his friends outside, yelled at my friends for "being Bengali", and yelled at us when we showed up for our reservation of over 10 people. While all of this was going on, he was extremely friendly (read touchy feely) with groups of girls that walked in.\n\nAlso, as noted by others already, they have filtered out negative reviews to only show positive ones. This place needs new management badly as it could be one of the best hookah bars in Philly with a proper owner who doesn\'t treat customers like shit. I went with three other people on a Thursday night for sheesha - though I have to explain that I don\'t like sheesha, so I was only there for the company.  So we seated ourselves (because no one was in sight), looked at the menu and were ready to order.  When the server approached us (who we later found out was the owner.....so much worse), the first thing he BARKED at us was that we HAD to order two sheeshas.  Why?  Because it\'s one sheesha per three people - and we were four.  I explained that I don\'t do sheesha - "It doesn\'t matter, you have to order two, now go think about it"....and he walked off.  At this point, my friend was fuming and ready to leave.  But we stayed.  We endured more awkward experiences every time we spoke to the "waiter."  When my husband asked him to fix the sheesha, because it was harsh, the response was "Have you never done sheesha before?  I\'ve been here since 1994 and no one has ever said it\'s harsh."  ERRRRR.  We were definitely overcharged for two sheeshas (the second of which was clearly forced on us), two teas, a diet coke and a slice of cheesecake clearly from ShopRite.\n\nI would not recommend this place - SOLELY due to BAD  service.  If you don\'t mind being treated like a horrible pest they can\'t wait to get rid of, this place has decent sheesha and green tea. I seriously only do reviews if I hate a place or love it. Unfortunately, this is not a good review for this place. There were originally supposed to be 12 people in our party, including myself and my best friend. She and I arrived before everyone else, so we decided to go ahead and start without everyone. We didn\'t even step through the door before we were stopped by this incredibly rude man on the phone. He asked how many, and we explained SEVERAL times that there were 10 other people coming, but she and I were going to start, and that it would only be us two. He told us to wait outside and would not let us in. After ten minutes of going back and fourth, we left and went somewhere. Please, DO NOT waste your money at this rude, overpriced, unprofessional establishment! Such a nice place nice music . Not expansive, I always go there. A good place to chill and have a good time. Really great hookah and it last long. I entered the guy attacked me ID never a hello looked at me scornfully asked me if I was high. Said well u only have 45 minutes looked at me scornfully ....clearly rude and unprofessional my friend walked pass too me it is a tasteful and tactful way u do things donot treat people according to the way they look everyone is a paying customer I was very offended and walked out... well maybe everyone won\'t have the same experience ....totally wack My fav go to hookah spot...chill atmosphere great staff...the owner Mike is a sweetheart...and the prices are great I\'ve been a regular of sorts since November and love it. Cheap ($11 for up to 5 people per hookah), awesome music, and their tea selection is great. Meh is the word to describe. The hookah is definitely the cheapest i know, but the waiter (and i assume owner) is an unfriendly man and definitely does not welcome the non-ethnic crowd very much. if you JUST want hookah then go here but i wouldn\'t go here for much more. Worst hookah experience ever. Overpriced and it smells really bad like some one pissed everywhere never come here ever I am from out of town , the owner was super accommodating for me and my friend on a Monday early morning. Music, drinks, and hookah is. Great! Definitely stop by when you have the chance !!! So far so good.  Just wanted a chill hookah spot.  Reasonable pricing and drinks.  Just wish they had food. When I first came here about a year ago, I was so excited that Philly finally had a place to smoke high quality, cheap sheesha while enjoying some authentic MIddle Eastern tea.  While the decor in Cleopatras is modest, it really reminded me of Horus Cafe in NYC, which is my favorite hookah place on the East Coast.\n\nThe first time we went to Cleopatras was when the cafe was new.  I remember the management being short with their words, but quick to bring free, extra coals and good mint tea.  Unfortunately, my friends and I have had a completely different experience since then...\n\nOne time we went and ordered 2 hookas for 4 or 5 people.  They seemed annoyed we didn\'t want a third hookah.  When I then asked for tea, the server/owner gave me an annoyed look and didn\'t say anything.  One of the guys in our group went to go remind them about the tea for our group because they never brought it.  They guy yelled at him to go sit down.\n\nAnother time we wanted to sit outside because it was a nice night out, and the owner told us we weren\'t allowed to, even though all the seats outside were free.  We said, "why can\'t we sit outside?" and he yelled that if we didn\'t want to sit inside we could leave.  Apparently, the outside tables are only reserved for the owner of the restaurant and his old male friends.\n\nAnother time we went our friend was leaning against a radiator next to our group of tables.  The owner came over and started yelling at him for leaning on the radiator (which wasn\'t on, it was summer) saying that he was causing a disruption.  My friend asked him to calm down and he would move, but then the owner called him a "black" (which he isn\'t, but apparently this was an insult - so racist) and our group left immediately.\n\nThe very last time we attempted to go, we had a reservation for an after-party of about 8 people or so.  As soon as we got there, the owner came up to us and started shoving us out the door, saying all the tables were full.  We said we had a reservation and we didn\'t mind waiting.  He starting screaming (like out of control anger) and shoving and getting in the guys\' faces in our group.  We left and never went back again.\n\nAlso, I\'m sure this will get "filtered" like all the other negative comments, but I wouldn\'t recommend supporting a business from this man.  He is rude, racist, and hostile, and I would not feel safe going back there again. Way too expensive, no menu, and no food. I feel like they looked me up and down, and said " this guy will pay 35 for a hookah, and a cup of coffee."  Never coming here again. Owners are gruff, but not rude. If you want obsequious or super friendly service yeah this isn\'t the place for you. Unfortunately with the number of shisha bars out there in a friendly service oriented society them running it like the corner shisha bar in Egypt probably won\'t go over so well for them. Anyways they seemed nice enough to me but I don\'t expect super friendly service. Place is pretty standard. Kinda pricey on the BYOB charges. Standard crappy electronic music that I\'ve heard in almost every shisha joint from here to Bosnia to Egypt. Very dark, as a shisha den should be. I attend TRS which is right up the block i havent been to a lot of hookah bars but out of all the ones ive been to this is one of the best the service is great and they have a nice range of flavors on the new menu Went with a group of friends and we were insanely overcharged. We had 4 hookahs and 13 drinks between 9 people and somehow the bill was $358. It should have been $12/ hookah and $8/ drink. Somehow he came up with 21 drinks and wouldn\'t itemize the bill so we could see what cost or how much tax really was. Will never go back. Don\'t waste your time or money. I noticed several people\'s negative comments got filtered. I wonder why.  This place was horrible and the workers were very unfriendly.  Lets just leave it at that.  I came here with my fiance to smoke hookah and after we finished we quickly left extremely furious about the service that we got.  DO NOT GO HERE! Run! Your best off buying your own hookah off ebay or amazon and hangin out in the comfort of your own home with your friends.  Thats what we ended up doing.  These people were very rude and nasty and i wanna say racist. Shit\'s changed, man.\n\n1) 2 people to a hookah at $12+ tax currently. Still cheap but....\n2)Staff is now very rude and unwelcoming for the most part.\n\nTime to find a new spot. At first this place looks kind of intimidating because it is really dark inside, and when you walk in you pretty much feel like you\'re walking in on a private event.  The people in charge here, though, are very friendly once you sit down and get to talking.  The hooka here is pretty cheap - it\'s ten bucks any flavor.  The flavors they have listed on the menu are mango, peach, apple, melon, mint, grape, two apples, orange, guava and cherry.  Other than that, they offer the regular hot/cold drink lineup, as well as cheesecake and homemade baklava.  No alcohol.  Not BYOB.  There are also two big TVs in here.  It\'s a simple setup, nothing fancy.  If you\'re hungry for actual food, you can just step over to kabobeesh. Shitty host..a bald guy comes in with out a menu..and says some random flavors..very in professional. Zero star worst place to have a hookah \nI ask for a mint shisha, he gives me the worst flavor I have ever tasted(not mint) I repeat I want tea the guy offers me alcohol, he makes assumptions I can\'t afford my hookah, I leave him the change and he says "thks m\'am" FYI Arab guys stop stereotyping Ethipiopian Women! The service is horrible the owner is ignorant  and rude. Currently there the hucca and price is decent. The ambience is dark and loud. I would only suggest based on price, better off smoking at home. No menu, no service. Got 2 hookahs for 3 people party. Cafe is only using single hose hookahs. No mention of price of hookahs or session. No bar menu, no tobacco list...no fruit bowls. Do they make food? No service, just awkward staring and a surprise price on the bill. We miss you Aloosh. Trying Luxor next. Wow, reading all the other reviews, I was worried that I would have a terrible experience. No way, it was solid. I visited with a friend around 11:30pm on a Saturday, and it was packed with groups of students each smoking 2-4 hookahs. They played Arabic music in the background, and had those crazy green-dot laser light beams going which I did find a little irritating. \n\nThe sheesha was good, inexpensive, and the mint tea was absolutely wonderful. The manager was very attentive and did keep a good eye on our coals, and changed them periodically. There is only one unisex bathroom for the entire place, and thankfully it was clean when I used it. Big plus.\n\nI had no issue with the management, the service, or the products, and I\'ll probably return here in the future. Happy that this place stays open late! They have good hookah at pretty fair prices (maybe a little expensive when you go in any group bigger than 5). We went in a huge group so the service was a little slow as I expected. I had an overall good experience here with funny, loud music and cool bubbles soap to blow smoke into. They don\'t even deserve one star. I wish I could give negative stars.  Customer service was the worst.  Dude got irritated because we inquired about having to pay for the coal separately or does it come with the hookah. We bounced. I will never go to this place again! The hookah is $30 per 2 people. It was barely pulling. They did not fix it. The drinks are all $15 they say it\'s top shelf and double shots in the liquor however you can\'t even taste the liquor and I bought two drinks. They snatched the hookah away and said it was done. This place is just HORRIBLE! Don\'t waste your time or your money!! Did not like the place and will not recommend it to my friends for following reasons:\n-Unfriendly server...bad attitude! ("There\'s no menu-I am the menu! What do you want")\n-When we brought the burning of the flavor into his notice, he asked if we had ever smoken a hukka before?!\n-Using charcoal instead of regular coal spoiled the experience\n-Accepted cash only-it was inconvenient! If you want cheap hookah and a soda or cup of tea, this place rocks. If you get hungry, this place sucks. Service is ok but the hookah was great for the price. Good and inexpensive Shisha which really don\'t make up for poor service!! customers choose to go there to chill not keep up with the rude owner!\nHalf Yelp! Are you a fan of rules? Do you enjoy strict guidelines? Does your idea of a night out include restrictions that even Mubarak himself would think too harsh?\n\nWell do I have a recommendation for you!\nCleopatra cafe has what every neofascist is looking for... \n\nAn empty seating area with a 45 minute smoking time restriction. \n\nA coal refill fee for those who smoke fast enough to finish their coals within the allotted time period. \n\nA star buzz price $5 greater than the other 4 or 5 hookah bars in the area.\n\nAn owner that will badger you repeatedly every 1.5 minutes after you tell him you\'re still deciding what to order until finally he asks you "are you waiting for more people to come or...?" and you decide to leave and go to Luxor cafe.\n\nDid you read this review and think "yes! I\'ve been wanting to return to the totalitarian homeland that my parents fled and requested asylum from"? \n\nWell then head on over to cleopatra cafe! Hello fellow creatures of the night\n\nA haiku (ish):\n\nAfter hours, here\nthe price we pay, decided \narbitrarily \n\nFun time$. Bulky pockets not so bulky when we left. \n\n\n4 stars for cleo\'s clandestine-ation and 1 for the cool dude who owns the gym upstairs, yeah! Terrible hell hole of a place. Especially when it comes to customer service and just being welcomed in an establishment where you are going to be spending your hard earned money!!!!Friday night/Sat morning 2:15ish am. Arrived with my cousin, the guy or owner seemed angry. Was very impatient seating us when NOBODY was in there except a group already seated. We picked our seat, he stands on top of us and tells us $30 for hookah. We said okay. He walked away, another guy came right after, repeated the price, then ask for payment at that very moment. We\'ve only been sitting for less than 5minutes!! Now I\'m turnt all the wayyy off at this point. We paid. Only to find out the place that sells food next door(runs by this establishment) is closed!! Even though we called and asked specifically about food and time but was not given adequate information. LACK OF BASIC INFORMATION! to PAYING customers!!!!! Business is about customers service. You are ignorant. This is not your area of expertise. Forgot to add, we left within 10mins of paying $30 to them for hookah. Didn\'t even touch it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS VOID OF A PLACE to anyone!! Was excited when I heard about a decent hookah bar in university city. However when we got there, we were greeted by extremely rude management who obviously didn\'t want any business at 9:45 on a Saturday night. After we left the cafe, the owner came outside and felt the need to further curse at patrons. We were simply trying to tell the manager that even though we had 10 people in our group, only 6 of us wanted to smoke hookah. He wasn\'t willing to deal with this even though the cafe was dead empty. He then proceeded to tell us that even though only one of us wanted to drink, it would be a $50 dollar surcharge. Management wasn\'t too happy when we told them not everyone in our party wanted to partake in the hookah and thus led to the ridiculously rude service. I will never attempt to go here again. Even though we had people who didn\'t want to smoke hookah, management wanted to charge $15 dollars per every 2 people for a hookah. What kind of service is this? I honestly can\'t comprehend how rude management was the minute we entered the cafe. You think they would be happy to see a crowd of 10 people walk in on a dead Saturday night. The fact that they then followed us outside and cursed at us out of nowhere was even crazier. There\'s really no words to explain the off the wall experience we had at this place. Cleopatra cafe\n\nA review \n\nAfter hours, here\nthe price we pay, decided \narbitrarily\n\nThat is my review you win some you lose some It may have been the owner, or just who was serving us, hut he was an older man. He was SO rude and very persistent, and pushy. We were waiting for some of our party to get out of the bathroom, and he kept coming over to us, asking to take our order, rushing us when clearly the rest of our party that he, himself seated were not present. Sitting there looking ay the menu, on the flip side of it was a full page\'s worth of a "list of rules" which automatically I knew was about to make me upset. I don\'t remember anything else but the "rule" that "you have no rights". That in itself did not sit right with me, or anyone else in my party for that matter. It was pretty loud, there were a lot of people, as well as music playing. I was trying to get my friends attention, so I called her name loud enough so she could hear me over the noise. And he told me to "calm down". I was not being inappropriately loud, so this really got under my skin. not long after we ordered, my party and I just got up and left. The owner of this place is racist. When I finally decided to visit this hookah place across the street, we got there and it looked closed and the door was locked. So as we were about to walk away the owner unlocked the door and let us in. We were of course the only people there. We asked if they have food here and he said no (Angrily) then we asked if they allow outside food since some places do that. He got upset and said I will charge each one of you $40 to eat here or you can get out THEN he proceeds to say RACIAL slurs that if I mentioned on yelp and he wasn\'t directing the racists slurs to us but towards African American customers who come there with food. I was gonna deal with his rudeness and let it go but racism just like that? Yeah I\'m not gonna let that one pass.  Don\'t go to that racist place. Let that be known. Unbelievably rude management. My friend went to the bathroom close to closing time and they kept banging on the door to get him to come out. At one point they threatened to call the police. He\'d been in there for 5 minutes. When he came out, he started smoking hookah because it was still working and they literally yanked the hose out and took it away without saying a word. I have never been treated this poorly anywhere else. I wish I hadn\'t tipped them but it\'s not like they gave me any choice. They never came back with the change once we paid the bill. this place used to be good but now it sucks. I went here a few weeks ago with two of my freinds .The manager told me they have a new rule that only two people can smoke one hookah. We told him politely that only 2 of us will be smoking because the 3rd person did not smoke but he was persistant and we had to leave. I was very dissapointed because this used to be one of my favourite places to hang out and chill This place is terrible pricy drinks rude staff and  terrible service . Mike one of the workers there were rude to me and my friends he told us that we could get out all because I asked him to turn the air up. I also asked him the price of my drink before I ordered it and told me he would come back with a price. Instead he came back with the drink and charges me $20  for one drink . Then I asked him to fix my coals on the hookah machine and he told me it didn\'t matter because I was about to get out anyway . I will never go back here again I don\'t care if someone\'s treating me I never been treated so bad in any business establishment. While the hookah was fair, the customer service was atrocious- the worst I\'ve ever been treated. It\'s probably not worth it to go into the specifics of our visit, but you would be wise to go somewhere else. All the while that my friend and I were at this place, we felt as if we weren\'t wanted there, and the owner was very cold and accusatory. It\'s very obvious that they have a privileged set of clientele that regularly visit them, most likely close friends and family. We do not intend on returning after our horrible experience. As other people have said, the service at this establishment is absolutely TERRIBLE.  I am not sure how the other reviewer, Marissa, convinced them to allow up to 5 people per hookah, but when I went last night they would only agree to seat us if we purchased 1 hookah for every 2 people, which is complete overkill when you have a group of 10.  They may be quick with the hookahs and coals, but they are also extremely impolite, impatient, and rude to customers.  They snapped the coal tongs in front of one of my friend\'s faces to get his attention, and one of the owners proceeded to later direct a racist comment at me (shouting "Hey! CHINA!!" in an angry manner to get my attention).\n\nI have come to Cleopatra previously and not had any big issues besides the slightly sub-par service, but this experience from last night has convinced me not to return.  Possibly the owner may have been having a bad day, but that is no excuse for the behavior we saw.  Go to one of the other hookah bars in West Philadelphia, I am convinced that they cannot possibly have worse service than Cleopatra Cafe. They are a bunch of racist bastards who deleted my last comment to make themselves look good. Do not go here if you are black, puerto rican or any other ethnic minority race. This place is utterly disgusting and should be shutdown! My fiancé and I were treated like shit here. Definitely should have read the reviews first.   Ordered $100 worth of pizza for a 13 year Olds birthday.  Gave then 2 hours notice.  The pizza still showed up an hour late, cold and tasteless.  Absolutely awful.    Never again. I now remember why we don\'t order from this Pizza Hut anymore - a year ago, it took two and a half hours for the deliveryman to arrive, and we live three blocks away.  Today, we called to request an ETA an hour after delivery and were told the deliveryman would leave in five minutes.  Half an hour later, we called again and were put on hold twice.  When I said I\'d been waiting an hour and a half, the person on the other end of the phone gave a sarcastic remark, so I told him to cancel the order.  The deliveryman showed up half an hour after that, and I turned him away.\n\nI will definitely never order from this Pizza Hut again. Delivery driver didn\'t bring entire delivery, said he would go back to store to grab it and didn\'t return. Store refused to refund money! Every time I order from here it\'s a little late, but today it was almost 2 hours late. They did call but it was about an hour in and they said it would be coming soon, but it was another 45 minutes after they called. Not even an apology for being so late...horrible service! Do NOT order from here if you want to receive the correct order. My boyfriend and I ordered a medium pizza (with the cheese bites crust and the garlic sauce) with onions and tomatoes on half and onions, bacon, and chicken on the other half. The pizza we received had chicken on the entire thing and had bacon on only two slices. This is a problem because I don\'t eat meat, hence meat only on half. They also forgot the dipping sauce for the cheese bites. We call to inform them that they messed up our order. They apologized and said another pizza would be there in half an hour. Half an hour later, we get another pizza. Guess what? This pizza still was not correct. At this point we gave up. It was not even worth calling at that point. Lesson learned, if you want the pizza you ordered do NOT order from this shop. It Pizza Hut nothing special. Just stop by to grab some wings. It a small take out branch right off of the high way. You would think it a big franchise. They would train the employees better food handling skills. Not what I saw. I\'ve been working in the back of the house for 10 years. I know there is some corner cutting here and there. But never with touching food after you touch money. The guy literally gave me my change and went straight to the walk-in fridge. Grab a pre prep pizza, then proceed to add the toppings. All with out washing his hands or wearing food gloves. Money is dirty!!! He not the only one. The other man who looks like the manger or something is worse. He just grab change for a delivery. Then went to pack up cooked orders. Lucky for me, he spilled something cleaned it up washed his hands. Then gave me my order. Also they ran out of bags. By far this place bad. I can see there is no box of gloves anywhere insight in the kitchen. Matter of fact I don\'t think they train them to even wear gloves. Com\'on even other fast food places wear gloves. This place is a joke!!! Guess I should\'ve read the Yelp review first. I ordered a dinner box at 12:08pm. The notification I received said my food would be delivered at 12:36. At 1pm when my food still hadn\'t arrived, I called the store and they assured me it would arrive in 5 minutes. The gentleman who answered was very nice. Finally, at 1:26, the driver (female) arrived. I was annoyed but she was apologetic and I empathized with her. At this point I\'m starving, and I look in the box to see BLEU CHEESE dressing instead of icing. So now I can\'t eat the cinnastix and the pizza was cold. I tried to request a full refund as this was a total waste of time and money but the form submission on Pizza Hut\'s Contact Us page is broken so I couldn\'t even do that. I will say the employees were kind. I don\'t know what happened to this Pizza Hut.  \n\nThe food wasn\'t very good at all.  Pizza slices weren\'t even cut through all the way.  They forgot to cook the breadsticks in my order.  She rung me up and then realized the mistake so I had to wait additional time.  The breadsticks were undercooked when I got them.  \n\nThe pizza actually made me sick the rest of the night.  I was very disappointed.  However, I gave them 2 stars because they lady who was at the register was very friendly.  She even offered me a free soda for the mistake.  Without her, it was a 1 star experience. I have to say I used to hate Pizza Hut very much pizza was horrible!! I always said I would never eat from there again. So after seeing these commercials for there new recipes and toppings and crusts I decided to give it a try one day. It officially a good pizza place now in my books toppings and pizza were fresh!!!!  The new honey siracha drizzle is amazing!! Delivery was fast and food was still hot. The only reason I did not give 5 stars  because I do not know how there customer service is since I only have ordered thru them online!! Visited this location because my nearby one was closed for the night. Though I didn\'t get delivery, the food was hot and better than my normal store. The toppings werent skimpy, all my sauces were included and the whole experience was pleasant.\n\nAlso, the woman working the counter was really pleasant! It happened twice, so my family and I waited almost 2hr for the delivery! And it was the same delivery man was extremely late and delivered cold pizza. Are they striving to be out out business!? Waited 1hr 30min and still waiting for my pizza to get delivered. I called to track my order but their excuse is,  "we are still waiting for our driver to get back. He left with 4 orders. I don\'t know why so many people was ordering so many pizza this morning." I asked for a new estimate time of arrival and he said, " um.. I can\'t really tell you that but maybe another 20mins. " but  30mins just passed still no delivery. Unprofessional! I don\'t understand the low reviews on here. Maybe I just got lucky. I\'ve ordered from here twice in the past couple months to a hotel near by. Both times the food was fast, hot, and the drivers were nice. I\'m not typically a person who visits or writes reviews for chain restaurants, but here we are. If you\'re interested in waiting well over an hour beyond the promised delivery time and being served cold pizza then this is the place for you! Last time we ordered (maybe 8 months ago) I called to let them know they didn\'t give me mushrooms as I had ordered. I was told that the mushrooms they had were moldy so that\'s why they didn\'t put them on. While I\'m glad that they didn\'t give me moldy food, a call with a heads up would have been nice. I could have replaced it with something else. That time it was well over an hour beyond the promised delivery date and they forgot our sides. Decided to give them another try last night. We got two pizzas, one of which was meant to have extra cheese, the other was meant to be thin & crispy with light cheese. Both pizzas had the same amount of cheese, both were cold and his was far from crispy. It was limp, soggy and cold. So after waiting an hour longer than expected we had to preheat our oven and cook the pizza so that it was edible. How this place is still open with all of these reviews is beyond me. Just don\'t. Bought a voucher for this Pizza Hut for 12.50 from cbs...the lady told me that they do not accept its saying that she doesn\'t know how to put it in the machine. How does she not know how to do it when it clear has the Pizza Hut location. On there that they will accept the voucher .. If I\'ve known I would of never order food from here Delivery times are 2hrs +\n\nPlease be warned that if you order delivery, expect it 2-2.5 hours later. I like pizza. I like generic franchise pizza. Hell, I recently won a free year of pizza from Papa John\'s as a runner up in a big contest they had.\n\nI like Pizza Hut\'s stuffed crust pizza.\n\nThere. I said it.\n\nSo get past your hate of the CONCEPT of Pizza Hut, and just look at this review from the POV of someone who actually likes the product. Because I do.\n\nSo...\n\nTHIS Pizza Hut is a disaster. For 3+ years I have had nothing but problems with them, but I keep coming back because they\'re the only one in town. The usual issue is that I order pineapple and they put on pepperoni. But there\'s other issues. \n\nSometimes it takes 2 hours to deliver because they\'re constantly under-staffed. \n\nOn numerous occasions they run out of a certain type of crust, so they call me and tell me they can only make another kind; the problem is, if I\'ve ordered online, my credit card has already been charged, so if I say "No, I don\'t want thin crust, I ordered stuffed crust," it won\'t stop my card from having $20 taken off of it until 10 days later when the charge is reversed.\n\nThey also constantly forget to include side orders and drinks, and then the driver has to go back to the store, and come back to drop them off, which makes the driver pissed...which makes me uncomfortable.\n\nBut...I keep ordering, because, like I said...it\'s the only Pizza Hut in town. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me 3 times, shame on me.  I\'ve ordered from this Pizza Hut 3 or 4 times now, and every trip has been a miserable experience.   \n\nThey say the pizza will be ready in 20-30 minutes, yet they tell you it will be another 20 minutes once you show up to pick up the pizza. I really should have kept this in mind whenever I have a thought of ordering from this location.  Please don\'t make the same mistake.\n\nAt least, as I\'m sitting in my car, waiting for the pizza, I\'ve seen 5 other people go in for their pizza, and no one has walked out with any - so at least I\'m not the only one. Don\'t let it be you too.\n\nTo me, there is no excuse. Can\'t they hire more people or get a bigger location?!?! I ordered a pizza at 7:20pm, the email said it would be delivered around 8:15-8:30. Figured that was fine. 9pm rolls around, still isn\'t here, I called and the night manager says "i dont know what you want me to say" okay I\'ll give the guy another 10-15 minutes, I don\'t live that far. 30 minutes later... (It\'s now 9:30pm) I call again "hey sorry it\'s me again, just trying to get an eta. It\'s getting a little ridiculous" the rude "manager" says "i dont know what you want me to say i dont know." No answers, no apology, no trying to find a solution.. Just rudeness. Awful, awful, awful. Make it even better, fold was cold. Called tonight because the website said they couldn\'t deliver, but COULD take carry out. I was told the manager shut down online orders because "For real real, all we have right now is large thin crust, and wings."\n\nWow. This place is a joke there should be a NO star option. it was 25 min late. The pizza was COLD and when I called to complain the man I spoke with said and I qote. \n\n"I understand that your saying the pizza was cold even though I know it wasn\'t"\n\nOn top of that when I called back they some how had messed up charging me so I only had been charged $1. Now they want me to pay for late and cold pizza. \n\nThis company has gone down hill. I lived in a different part of the city an if I got delivery it was late or cold as well. . . . only way to get fresh HOT pizza is pick-up. \n\nSo I will NEVER order pizza hut again. I have worked in the food industry for about 10+ years and if some one is not happy you don\'t charge them.. you comp the meal. Not say we\'ll your paying for this one we can give you your next free.. \n\nSo to recap. COLD pizza.  LATE pizza. And RUDE staff (except the delivery guy. He was nice.. late but nice. ) Third time we waited OVER TWO HOURS for delivery. Called at an hour in to check on our order, because the "tracker" hadn\'t moved past "received order". Girl who picked up was rude, informed us they only had one driver (on a Friday night), and that our order was done and "still" waiting there to go out. Ok, fine, at least it was made. Two hours in-Called 5 more times to ask they just cancel our order, and no one would speak after they picked up.  Sounded like they picked up, and shoved a cordless phone into a pocket. Way to run a business. Just as my husband and I were discussing who was going to drive down there to cancel in person and get a refund, guess who calls? Delivery girl just arrived, and literally almost dropped our order in front of my husband, but luckily caught it before it hit the ground. Fries were burnt, mozz sticks under cooked and everything was ice cold. NEVER. AGAIN. Worst customer service experience. Had some issues with the mobile website and it reverted to my old phone number. But when I called the store, the staff member basically blamed me and hung up. The manager called back and also blamed me for the delivery guy going to the wrong place (my additional instructions apparently did not go through on the website order). He said the driver might redeliver but that I was basically taking the hourly rate from the driver. I work in food service and would never tell a customer that they cost an employee money, even if it was true. He said I should wait out on the corner but never said the driver was definitely coming back. I waited 10 minutes but had to go back to work. My coworkers ordered from another place and got their food right as the driver showed up from PH (he didn\'t come in, one of my coworkers saw him outside and chased him down). One girl still wanted her food and I felt bad for the driver so I paid for all the food and tip so it was the most expensive personal pan pizza I\'ve ever gotten ($13+) and at this point it was cold and the pizza box was pretty beat up.\n\nWe got our food an hour and a half after we ordered it and 45 minutes after the stated delivery time (on a Tuesday). It was not fresh and the staff was unaccomodating, not helpful and generally not pleasant.\n\nA previous experience with this location was when I placed an order online about 30-45 before their stated close time and they just never showed up. No online notice or call. was working here for a month now i get fired because customer called me names cursed me and i had no way to contcat store becuse the phones have been down over a month.\n\nHere comes the legal help now DO not order from here period.\n\nSeems like the cooks do not want to help drivers at all and this causes problems . \n\nYOUR order will be screwed up mising stuff or replaced with other food because they were out of what you wanted and the Gen mgr phone cant talk to you only text n e mail. LOL what a joke I swear I haven\'t Yelped a review in ages but this place is so awful that I just HAD to warn people. The family and I have ordered from here since they\'ve first opened several years ago. We\'ve done both pick up and delivery numerous times and almost every single time it\'s like getting your teeth pulled. Pick up is ok, face to face customer service is mediocre (think checkout at our local S Philly Wal-Mart...yep), and the 15 min wait is 8 times outta 10 really 30 mins. Imagine a car with 2 toddlers, a elementary schooler and a hungry hubby at the end of a long day waiting outside of the Pizza Hut for 30 or so minutes. Oh yeah, I timed it. Delivery is AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL! The order NEVER arrives before an hour and once it took 2 hours. Of course the food was cold. We\'ve never gotten hot food delivered to us NEVER! When I called to ask about the food,  someone answered with a "we\'re closed" and hung up the phone (sooo Wal-Mart).\n\nSo having not done business with these jerk offs for about a year, I decided to give them another chance because I\'m a pretty forgiving, optimistic kinda gal. So about 2 weeks ago while visiting family about 6 blocks from the Pizza Hut on Front st, we ordered for delivery online. Our confirmation told us the expected arrival time was 2:54pm. Nice, that was about a 40 minute wait time. 3:00-nothing. 3:15-nothing. I call, guy with accent (Indian? Pakistani?) tells me delivery guy is out should be about 5 more minutes. Umm... we\'re 6 blocks away on an Oregon Ave intersection, the drive from there to P.Hut is only 3 minutes tops. I should know. I\'ve drive thru-ed Mc D\'s, ordered, paid, received AND parked at the family\'s house in 5 minutes several times... GRRR! Anywho, about 3:40, we get a call saying delivery guy was outside. Open the door AND big fat NO FRIGGIN BODY! Car comes up the street pulls up and here\'s our order. FINALLY! He\'s like "Sorry, there was traffic." I looked down the 6 blocks and then looked at him. Really? He just went there like I\'m such an imbecile to believe that he was stuck in 40 minute traffic to get 6 FRIGGIN BLOCKS! Not even sure that I should mention that he sounded EXACTLY like the same guy who originally told me the delivery guy was already out. My friend ordered from here and the man that answered doesn\'t seem bright or is it just plain laziness? One time she went in on a Wednesday for the wacky wing Wednesday special. "Uhhh I don\'t usually work Wednesdays so I can\'t give you that special" she points out it\'s on the window advertising and he still refuses! "I can give you a pizza nobody picked up". Other time she calls for delivery. He answered the phone and told her it would be at least 2 1/2 hour wait for delivery. Ok fine. The food comes in a half an hour and the pizza wasn\'t cooked all the way through and the boneless wings were dry instead of being boneless and one with mild sauce and one with BBQ. Call the store. The guy says "uhhhh I don\'t know what you want me to do" she asks for a new order. "I can\'t do that" He offers a credit for next order! But I\'m hungry now! "I don\'t know what to say". Seriously is this how you treat people. Ok let me speak to a manager. He says I\'ll have him call you back in an hour he\'s not here. After waiting she calls back and he says hold on and the SAME GUY gets on the phone and tries to change his voice lol. This place sounds like a joke. I wouldn\'t order from here and neither should you. OK all of you who cannot call the front st location 2715 s front st Call me on my cell 267-237-8458 or text the general mgr at 267-269-2565 his cell is broken cannot call or recive calls lol \n\nI can get the orders to the manager on duty today from 4 -11 tomorrow 11- 6 and mon. 11-5 \n\nDunno why they cant get phones fixed some weird company exclusive to pizza hut serves them. Spider, spider everywhere! Best for the Halloween day ;-) We had to literally kill a few spiders inside the washroom and one nearby the bed. Worst hotel I ever lived... Even non-smoker room smell smokey, tiles and fixtures were broken (check the posted pics), and the water was dripping all night. The whole corridor felt damp and smell nasty :-0 We were forced to stay here, as there wasn\'t anything else nearby, and we were unfamiliar of the city, and it was 9:00 at night to search another after 8 hours of driving :-( Worst hotel I ever lived. Had to take this because there wasn\'t anything else nearby, and we were unfamiliar of this city, and it was 9:00 at night to search another after 8 hours of driving :-( This hotel is nowhere near as bad as the reviews say. I was on my way here wondering how could the hotel pics and the reviewers pics be completely diff. I arrived and granted the entire hotel looks better than the rooms but it does not look dirty the blankets look fine it has a fridge and microwave idk what the problem was I stayed here only one night as a rest stop during a road trip. We had driven about 5-6 hours, got there around 10 pm, and the whole place is pretty shady. The area surrounding it isn\'t so bad, there is fast food places, gas stations, breakfast spots etc. We were given a different room because they "accidentally" sold all the rooms with king beds, so we settled for 2 full beds. Not sure the exact bed size they advertise it as, but those beds were SMALL. My boyfriend and I have a full in our apartment and this was at least 50% smaller. We actually just ended up sleeping in separate beds. Had to make the best of it, right?\n\nI bought a nonsmoking room. This room smelled TERRIBLE, almost like someone has been smoking in it 2 hours prior to our arrival and they tried to cover it up with spray. The white curtains had big brown stains all of them, the comfortor had holes in it, and there were large cracks and gaps in the bathroom between the walls and floor.\n\nFor the price I paid, about $80 (rate for purchasing over a month in advance), I should expect TOO much more in Philadelphia. Horrible, absolutely horrible.\n\nYou know you\'re in for a bad experience when you see a police officer talking to the staff at the reception desk upon arrival.\n\nA lot of the rooms were dirty, including the bathrooms.  A majority of the people in our wedding party had these complaints.  \n\nAlso the pool was always full, not with hotel clients, but with people who lived in the area.  This is the first hotel I\'ve seen that was a "community pool."\n\nContinental breakfast was meh.\n\nAvoid if possible. This could have been the trip from hell, but thank goodness I\'m resourceful. I went to Philadelphia for a really quick trip (1 night). My sister booked my hotel room and soon as we got off the highway from CT we pulled into the Ramada. When I parked, there was a couple walking out with 3 small children. The woman who I shall assume was the mother told my sister not to get a room there, because her child found a used condom. We went in anyway, which was a mistake! Absolutely disgusted is what I was to put it into plain terms. There were stains on the sheets, comforters, and the bed skirt looked like it\'d never been changed EVER! The shades on the lamps were broken, and looked as if they had cigarette burns or sun damage which caused visible rips in the shade. There was human hair all over the floor in the bathroom, and the shower curtain was white with mold stains at the bottom. To top off the plain old nastiness in the bathroom the garbage which appeared to possibly started off as a white plastic receptacle was now yellow with a horrible black stain around the bottom. After we left our room we spoke with management who told us that the room we\'d book was their BEST room and according to him it was rarely rented out. THIS was enough to know that if this was their best then there worse must look like a cell in Alcatraz!  I left there and booked a hotel in Cherry Hill, NJ. I was so tired of driving seeing as I\'d just drove from CT, but a 30 min drive was better than staying a night in hell! Please spare yourself and don\'t rent a room here--you may catch bed bugs or who knows Hep C. Room is clean, some ammenities, has all the soaps and lots of towels, nice staff. Gym stinks, old equipment, not working, very little. Vending machine got stuck, they would not refund money and had to purchase the same item again. So dirty & gross!!...if I could I would give it no stars..make sure u save ur money for a room where u don\'t have to be scared to take a shower to top it off they had the worst breakfast I\'ve ever seen! No/ don\'t do it.  I was so grossed out and scared but had been up since 3:30am, drove to bring my dad in for surgery and had to crash. I wish I had not been lured by the cheap price. Who even has smoking rooms anymore? Ruins the whole hotel. \n\nYoung people loitering out front late at night made me feel very unsafe. My room was miles away from the front desk. Surprised I slept at all. We stayed here one night to be close to airport because of expected snow. It was the only hotel with a room available and now we know why. It is old. rundown, and the only clean thing about it were the sheets. Old cracked walls and furniture, stained curtains. The sign at front desk says to pardon the appearance during renovations but didn\'t see any renovations anywhere. If we were not desperate to catch our flight to Fl tomorrow, we would never ever stay here. Also, front desk staff were kind of cold and unwelcoming. Area is kind of shady. This is a dirty & disgusting hotel. Bad customer service the Manager at this location doesn\'t deserve to be running a hotel. Horrible 3 days experience in philly. The 30th Street Cosi doesn\'t feature anything special that sets it apart from any of the other Cosi locations in the city (say, Rittenhouse or 36th and Walnut), but it works for when I\'m en route to the train and craving a hot drink or something to munch on and a WiFi friendly spot if I have time to kill.  My usual if I\'m sitting in for a meal is the pesto chicken melt or a chicken margherita flatbread pizza, but it\'s highly unlikely that will happen at this Cosi.  Only if I miss my train.... The food is good, but the service here is AWFUL.  There are long lines and the staff has zero sense of urgency so you wait to order, and then you wait for your food...for a long time.  A good work around is to order online and then just go pick it up. Free Wi-Fi and standard Cosi food and prices should put this place at a 4 star - but the gruff service was a bit of a put off. On the other hand, the food came in 3 minutes and they got my order right, so it\'s hard to complain. But seriously, just smile once in a while! At least one person on the staff!\n\nOn a side note, they have plenty of seating in the café - a rarity for food options in the station. I enjoy a good tea, especially when I am about to get on the train or a plane and know I will be dehydrated for awhile.  The 30th Street Train Station has a variety of options for tea and other drinks, but I think this Cosi rates. The service is always good, the staff really is friendly and quick to serve (they realize, I think, that most of us are running for the train and time is of the essence), and they accommodate your desires.  I was able to buy a large sized tea with one tea bag and a little soy on the side. Now that is not something I can do at just any tea or coffee shop.  \n\nI will continue to use Cosi when I am travelling through the train station! I only popped in for a cappuccino but while I was waiting had some time to look at the menu. I really appreciate when a menu can cater to people with different diets. Cosi had something for everyone! The amount of vegan and gluten free options made me very excited! Most places don\'t have many gluten free soups, soup is something I miss. Cosi had a couple!\n\nThey have plenty to eat for those who have no limitations as well. It would be a great place to stop and have a quick bite to eat with friends or just on a lunch break. I always looked over Cosi but in the future will definitely be stopping in for something to eat. \n\nThe staff was friendly and very attentive. I also noticed on one of their signs that they donate a portion of their profits to those in need. Overall, a great company! \n\nOh and my cappuccino was delicious! I have to recognize this particular Cosi for excellent customer service. I was waiting for my train, I stopped in during a busy dinner hour. My food came out quickly, but my drink was forgotten. The employee was extremely friendly, apologetic, and made it right after. Additionally, the manager came over, apologized, and offered a free entree. I noticed the manager working right alongside the staff and also checking to see if the seating areas needed to be cleaned. The food was your standard Cosi food, but the service really stood out and was appreciated. Today me and my 4 friends went to cosi to enjoy the "make your own smores"...which we were very excited about. We ordered a big tray of smores for the 5 of us, and the person taking our order said he would bring our smores to our table upstairs. After a few minutes he came upstairs to serve us our smores. When he went to light the fire so that we could toast the marshmellows, he said lit the match, held it up, and said a ritual as his eyes rolled back. He said something along the lines of "Curse God for bringing fire to mankind" and then lit our tray for our food. It gave me and my girlfriends a very uneasy feeling, and we went to speak with the manager right away. The manager was really nice to us about the situation but she also wasn\'t surprised that it happened. However she did fully refund us and gave us 2 free entree passes. I just wanted to post this to the cosi Facebook page so it doesn\'t happen again. We also noticed at the end that he was handling the food without gloves and extra long nails. All I can really say is yes to the signature salad. After two days of travel and bad food, my digestive system needed a salad. This one had pears, grapes, pistachios, Gorgonzola cheese, and mixed greens. Coupled with a smoothies from a vendor nearby it made the train ride home healthier. A "baked omelet sandwich" here translates over to "processed rectangular block of egg-not, two leaves of spinach, and one slice of ham served on a ciabatta-like square-doughnut-shaped bagel-wannabe."\n\nWhen paired with a large coffee, the total ends up being under four dollars.  Well, you get what you pay for... and given this is Cosi (which, again, has yet to impress me), that\'s not a whole friggin\' lot.\n\nLike DC\'s Union Station, Philly\'s 30th Street Station\'s food options don\'t leave a whole lot of wiggle room for decent dining. This is my first one star rating.  Cosi\'s at 30th Street Station is an AVOID.\n\nI dashed in there at 4pm, hoping to eat something before 430pm train left the station -- since Amtrak has Sovietized the train food to the point that I couldn\'t bear one more micro-waved hot dog.\n\nSo out-witting Amtrak, I went to Cosi with a business colleague.  We had standard orders and got the number gizmos.  Wait, wait.  You wait here, I\'ll get some reading.  I have time to buy some newspapers, magazines, and come back.  Wait, wait.  The only ones with any urgency and me and my colleague.  4:20pm -- train\'s at Track 5.  Now it\'s 4:25pm -- gotta go -- train\'s here.  Finally, the first order appears and then mine.\n\nAnd I ask one question is there plastic ware - knife, fork -- in the bag?  Oh yes the woman says authoritatively , , , , dash to the train.  No knife.  So I have to go to the Amtrak five-star dining car . . . . I had a Salad from Cosi that after two bits was inedible (Asian Chicken).  And the Bacon-Tomato-Chicken sandwich -- C-\n\nThis Cosi counts on the fact that if you have a complaint, you will be 30 miles from the Cosi before you discover you\'ve been had.  The staff is indifferent to your train plight, and counts on the train to whisk away your complaint.  Avoid this Cosi. I usually love Cosi, but this is literally the worst one (by far!) that I have ever been to. Cashier was rude to begin with, and then my order of two salads + a soup was made incorrectly FOUR times. The cashier didn\'t apologize even once. The salads, when we finally got them, were terrible - watery and over dressed and the bread was stone cold. \n\nFor the record, here is how they got my order wrong:\nI ordered a steakhouse salad, a small tomato soup, regular bread, and a signature salad with no cranberries and light dressing. \nFirst - wrong bread type and no soup\nSecond - wrong soup \nThird - my salad came with cranberries and regular dressing\nFourth - my salad came with no cheese This is my second time to Cosi. I come to 30th street often. Last visit I needed a quick dinner so stopped in for a sandwich. This time, breakfast. \n\nI was happy with the number of vegan and vegetarian options on the menu. The food is actually decent. I was really impressed with my breakfast wrap this morning and probably would get it again-at a different location. \n\nTwo problems: the portions are very small and the customer service is horrendous. \n\nI ordered the TBM for dinner and thought "oh for $5-6 the half is plenty!" I feel like there was two bites and my sandwich was gone. My breakfast wrap was the same way. I\'m not looking for a gigantic serving size, but these portions are tiny. \n\nBoth trips to this location the service was awful. When I came in for dinner I asked the lady how she was doing (as I always do before ordering) and she looked at me blankly and said "what do you want". This morning, different lady, same response. When she gave me my number, I wished her a good day and she said "yeah". When my food came out I thought the gentleman said a totally different number and when I asked him what number he said he called my number. I apologized and he literally threw my bag on my table and walked away. No other words spoken. With the slogan "be kind to each other" Cosi really needs to step it up. I\'m not looking for some feel good smiles and sunshine place in the middle of downtown Philly but goodness they could stand to improve their service. \n\nI think I\'ll likely stick to the convenience store for a quick bite and to the breakfast spot next door for hot food. Cosi is Cos"no".  At 8:30 am on a Monday here was the situation.\n22 minute wait for Oatmeal - no warning that they were out and needing to cook a new batch\nNo strawberries at the oatmeal bar\nNo spoon in the almonds at the oatmeal bar (folks used their hands)\n4 empty coffee carafes and the only available was lukewarm \nNo salt at the condiment table. (The employee said she would have to get some out of stock)\nNo napkins\n\nNo mas!!!\nCosi you got to do better in a damn major transportation hub!!! [ food ]\nHave stopped by here a few times for breakfast before the Amtrak. Egg/cheese squagels and the TBM melt usually hit the spot. Love their whole grain flatbread. \n\nCoffee is okay. They will even do soy drinks, which is cool.\n\nToday, however, we got a basil tomato soup and it was cold. We asked them to heat it up and they microwaved it...came back and it was lukewarm, so we had to ask them to microwave it again.\n\nThat\'s been my only bad experience here.\n\n[ seating / atmosphere ]\n\nClean and spacious. Nice cushiony chairs, heavy, sturdy tables. Plenty of seating, big tables, a nice place to camp out and get some work done. WiFi and outlets if you snag the right table.\n\n[ overall ]\nNice for a break, a quick rest, or doing some work. Music is a little loud but not  overbearing. Service speed is reasonable but not lightning fast. Decent spot. I said three times no egg on my breakfast sandwich. Did they listen? Nope! \n\nThis place is good if you need something with WiFi and for other meals, but I\'m giving two stars since I didn\'t feel like I was taken seriously this morning. I will be going elsewhere next time I need a quick grab-and-go breakfast Not bad for a chain restaurant in a train station.  The food came out quickly and no one really bothered us while we killed time waiting for the train.  There was a little bit of a fruit fly issue though, but that may have been a fluke. Ordered a half-and-half buffalo bleu sandwich (light lettuce) and mac and cheese combo online an hour before my train got there. When I stopped at Cosi, they completely forgot the macaroni and cheese and flatbread (that I submitted in the order) and made me pay for a small. To top it all off, it took fifteen minutes for my sandwich to be ready - with light dressing instead of light lettuce, and they forgot the side of flatbread.\n\nEssentially, they made a mistake in their order and not only refused to correct it, but made me pay extra to get what I originally ordered.\n\nAvoid at all costs. You\'re honestly better off with the cafe car. And when you\'re so bad that I\'m taking reheated Digiorno over it, I\'m not dealing with it. The only reason this Cosi stays in business is because of its location. If I could give it less than one star, I would. I come through the station every morning and on numerous occasions (between 15-20) have stopped here for coffee and sometimes, food. Each time, I hold out hope that they will get my order right and each time, I am let down. I give up! Out of my numerous orders they have only ever managed to get the drink right once. ONCE!!! If I order a mocha, they give me a latte. If I order a Honey Vanilla White Chocolate Mocha, they ALWAYS give me a regular and I have to go back and ask them to fix it. The bread is overdone or underdone, never right. I am so used to the service at other Cosi stores that is actually good, that I kept holding onto a sliver of hope that maybe, just maybe, they will get my order right this time.  I officially resign this hope and will from now on will go around the Cosi to the Saxby\'s behind it, where they get the order right every time. \n\nTD;DR: Skip Cosi and go to Saxby\'s. Generally I\'ve had pleasant experiences with Cosi, but not at all with this one. First of all, the cashier did not give me change when I handed him a $10 for $9.50 or so order. It\'s not the few cents I\'m upset about losing. It\'s the taking advantage of a customer that\'s bothersome. Secondly, I ordered the smart fit salad which comes with sweet potatoes. All of them were raw. One of the grossest salads I\'ve ever had. I will never order it again. Why are people hating on the Cosi? Admittedly, all I got was a cup of tea, but the service was prompt and polite. I usually can\'t stand Cosi, but about this one I have no complaints. Even my work around of ordering online doesn\'t work any more. When you order online you can choose "ASAP" and it gives you the estimated time. I usually give them an extra 10-15 minutes on top of that. And yet here I am, waiting 20 minutes so far (past my pickup time!) for a bakers dozen of squagels....and seeing that they have baskets and baskets of them on the counter. How long does it take to count to 13? They don\'t even have to box them - they give them to me in a bag. All they have to do it throw 13 of them into a paper sack and send me on my way. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!?! Poor excuse for a Cosi. The burned ("toasted") squagel I ordered went so nicely with the bad attitude of the cashier and employees.  Do better, Cosi. Do better. Cosi is a great option for Gluten Free diners! The GF items are clearly marked on the menu boards. There were several GF salad and soup options to choose from. I travel to Philadelphia via Amtrak several times a month. At this point I\'ve probably eaten here about 10-15 times. I am not exaggerating when I say my order has been correct less than half the time.\n\nAll I ever get is the chicken TBM. Not the melt, but the normal sandwich. One of the first times I stopped at this location, I got a melt when I didn\'t ask for one, so I\'ve resorted to specially asking for "not the melt" when I order. Again today I got a melt. This melt was also burnt to the point where I took a bite and the bread snapped in half all the way down the sandwich.\n\nThe bigger issue I have is they constantly put the spicy mustard on the sandwich and not the vinaigrette (it\'s supposed to come with the vinaigrette) Considering how great Cosi\'s vinaigrette is, this completely changes the sandwich. When switched the mustard is so strong it\'s overpowering. I\'ve probably had this happen 4 or 5 times. It\'s gotten to the point where I get excited when my order is actually correct. I wonder if they look really similar or what the issue is? \n\nI would stop coming here, but alternatives here are bleak. When they do get it right, it is a good sandwich also! Food is not prepared well, but is ok. The biggest problem is that the seating area reeks of urine. Horrible service. I had to wait for 20 minutes for my latte because they clearly forgot my order. My bad.  My mistake.  I shoulda known better.\nI stopped in for a "squagel" (whole grain with cream cheese).\nI was given a number (73) and told to wait.\nI waited about 3-4 minutes.\nNot worth it.\n\nSat like LEAD inside my stomach.\n\nI did it before a few years ago, and I guess I forgot.\nNow I remember.\n\nI will not be back to Cosi. This cafe is very clean, the cashier was very funny, and it smells good here. I had the TBM sandwich with carrots and water. Everything was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back next time I\'m in the area! The first couple of times I went here it was great! The bagels are really good, and their egg Florentine breakfast sandwich on a everything bagel was delicious....until I ordered it today and there were NO EGGS on it! What the hell? It was just spinach, swiss and the artichoke spread. It was extremely disappointing and now I\'m hesitant to go again because this place isn\'t the cheapest when I thought I found a new go to spot. Not so. How can you not put eggs on an egg sandwich????? I don\'t trust this place now. I\'m only going to write about my breakfast experience here while I was traveling for work. \nCosi has great options for lunch, even dinner, and the bread is terribly addicting, but I cannot get over how bad their coffee is. It\'s too bitter tasting (and I\'ve tried a lot of coffee) and leaves the worst taste in my mouth. The "squagel" is a cute substitute for a bagel but it takes a bit more effort than I would like to eat it. I\'m fine with Cosi as a chain, and they have do great selections, and overall, a great go-to restaurant for 3 meals/day, but they have to do something about their coffee!  Meh. Cosi is my usual stop while I\'m waiting for my train transfers... There is fairly reliable wifi, lots of seating, lots of electrical outlets! and no one rushes you out of here.\n\nThe food is also good. Most of their options are fairly light, fairly fresh and fairly fun! I would stick to the sandwiches or salads as I was very disappointed with the pizzas... but all in all, I really enjoy this place. I sometimes even check to see how much time I have between transfers so I can grab myself a sandwich for the next leg of my trip.\n\nIf you want to grab just a side of the bread (which I do once in a while) it\'s $1.00 and usually warm and chewy. Once in a while you will get handed a cold brick, but it is rare.\n\nThey give you a number card no matter how small your order, and will bring it to your table with a smile on their face. It takes a bit of time, maybe 5-7 minutes per order but that\'s alright with me. Steer clear if you need to run somewhere though, it is not fast fast food. Worst Cosi ever. I ride Amtrak a lot and am always disappointed with this location. Rotten lettuce. They don\'t mix dressing in with the salad even when asked. I always feel gross after eating here. We stopped here for an early lunch and it was good. We went with a turkey melt and a salad. The staff was friendly and we all had a good laugh with the "Chips or carrots?" option.  Both items came out quickly and the sandwich was nice and warm. No issues with us taking our time and sitting at the table for awhile since we were a bit early for our train. \n\nThis is a solid option in the 30th Street Station. Kinda surprised with some of the negative reviews. Our experience was good. I think people need to remember that this is a chain restaurant located in a busy train station. It\'s really not that bad.\n\nI first came here around midnight on my way home from the airport. Because it was so late, there were very few people inside, which made service very quick. \n\nI ordered the Turkey & Brie Sandwich--unbelievably good. I love the flatbread they use, it\'s always amazing.\n\nThe service was average, but not bad enough to knock another star off. This is probably my favorite dining establishment at the 30th Street Station. You get exactly what you expect, no more, no less. Ordered a salad and didn\'t have high hopes for it, thank GOD. It was by far not worth even 1/4 of what I paid for it, it consisted of 75% of ends of the romain head of lettuce. AWFUL! Don\'t recommend getting a salad there Needed breakfast and Cosi looked like a good option.\n\nWrong again Amtrak Traveling breathe! \n\nThe egg/bacon/cheese square bagel or a squagell in Cosiland was inedible. The eggs were not real eggs AND they were cold. The bacon was that fake microwaved garbage. I threw it away after forcing down two bites. The coffee was not hot. \n\nNEVER AGAIN! I love Cosi, but this location is no good! They skimp with portions and although there is a lot of sitting room, it\'s pretty untidy. The service at this Cosi is awful. I\'ve been about four times and the only reason I\'ve gone is that it\'s in the 30th Street Station and sometimes they have free bread samples.\n\nThe last time I was there, I ordered a latte, which no one ever made. When I finally said something, I was given a plain coffee. When I showed the server my receipt he said "you never told me it was a latte." Yeah, never told you, except five minutes earlier. He then made me a latte, which was lukewarm and had no foam. I asked if there was any foam left (I should have just left well-enough alone) he told me that lattes don\'t have foam. He also muttered "snob" as I walked out.\n\nNext time I\'m at 30th Street, I\'ll get coffee elsewhere or just live without it. This location is convenient and much more  organized and speedier service than the one on 36th street .... They always get my order correct unlike the 36th street location ... service has been overall pleasant. Best spot in 30th street for a quick breakfast before your train. They take your order, you sit down, they bring it out to your table when it is ready. This is an often underappreciated convenience, especially if you are doing other things in preparation for your trip. \n\nThe food is fine for what it costs (This is cosi, not the capital grille).  \n\nThe Americano I had was OK, you\'d be better off getting your coffee at Saxbys right outside the door to cosi. Usually when I visit a Cosi location I expect a certain level of service. Similar to Panera Bread or Starbucks. Not fine dining but not McDonalds. I didn\'t get that a few months ago. I\'m glad I\'m moving so I don\'t have to deal with the rude staff.\n\nNormally when I go to Cosi it\'s to grab the a turkey bacon cheddar melt and a drink before or after a train ride out of state. Recently I got off the train about 8pm or so and was waiting for my ride to pick me up. I hadn\'t eaten since 1pm so I got a sandwich and ate in the station. About ten minutes later I got a call from my ride saying she was going to be late because of a major traffic accident. I took this as a time to pick up another drink.\n\nBiggest mistake ever. This was 8:30ish maybe? Not the 9pm closing time. They look like they want to close at 8pm and they work as hard as possible to push people out. I grabbed two of their premade drinks and a fruit cup to snack on since the traffic sounded bad. The cashiers disappeared to the back for about ten minutes while I\'m standing there with my hands full of drinks, fruit and my wallet! Then my favorite part...\n\nThe sandwich maker tried waving me out of Cosi! Rather than grab a cashier or even try to ring me out himself he waves at me in the "go away" attitude and says bye! What?! Did he want to comp my drinks for me or something? He should\'ve with that attitude. Finally a cashier appears and the transaction was relatively painless. It would be nice if I could get a half decent smile. Or any pleasant reaction. I get it. It\'s late. You wanna go home. But it\'s only a half hour and nobody was making you break your back.\n\nIf I did this at my job I\'d get the biggest lecture if I even had my job afterword. I purchased a steak salad here poor qulaity meat..not to mention the amount of meat you get (I had to cut the meat into smaller pieces to cover my salad) the salad was also just drenched in dressing. I guess you can blame me for not asking for the dressing on the side. Over all the food was bad but I can\'t complain about the service or prices 2 stars. "Oh man, I\'m stuffed. I just had dinner at Cosi..." yeah, I\'m pretty sure nobody has ever uttered these words. The food isn\'t bad, but for the price, I expect more. The portions and sandwiches are a bit on the small side. The last time I was there, I had the turkey bacon cheddar melt. It came with a small bag of chips and a small bowl of salad. My friend put it best when he called it  "chick food" (no offense ladies). \n\nThe decor puts forth a modest attempt to be trendy but struggles to be anything more than just bland and generic. In a lot of ways it\'s evocative of Starbucks, and not in a good way. \n\nThe wait staff wasn\'t impressive either. We saw our waitress very intermittently. Apparently she had other tables downstairs and outside, but this is inexcusable to me. It took a long time for our food to come out, and when it did, I got a salad with my meal, not because I ordered it, but because they ran out of soup. It\'s a bit rude when you find this out by having it placed in front of you. \n\nAll in all, Cosi is overpriced and dangerously close to being fast food, except for the fact that it takes such a long time to get your food. Not great at all.  The coffee is pretty bad and my chicken noodle soup was extremely salty.  Stick to Au Bon Pain for better and fresher options.  The best part was the multigrain flat-bread, which was only semi-decent.  It is one of the few options still open at midnight at 30th Street Station, though. They always seem to get my order wrong. Today, for example, I ordered a full sandwich to go, was charged for a full sandwich,  and got to my destination only to notice they gave me a half sandwich. I am a huge Cosi fan, but this location is just average. However, You have to take into consideration that it is located in a train station. \n\nFirst, this location is on the smaller side. Therefore, there is limited seating and an odd setup. However, it was not too big of a problem. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty crowded when I came in, but they had plenty of open cash registers so I did not have to wait. I ordered a TBM with carrots, orange juice and chocolate chip cookie. The lady who took my order was pretty friendly and polite. \n\nThis Cosi offers grab and go items including their iconic breakfast sandwiches. \n\nMy order came out very fast, but it came in a plastic bag and not a plate. However, it was at the train station so I was okay with that.\n\nMy food was the ok. The TBM was a little mushy and not too warm. However, it had a nice taste. The carrots were fine. The cookie was below average compared to other Cosi location\'s cookies. \n\nI may return when back at 30th Street Station. Argggh!!! You suck!\n\nWe all know that your food is just ok and your prices are ridik, but the thing that makes me slap this location with my rarely-handed-out one-star is the bottom-of-the-barrel service.\n\nI\'ve been here once before and ate in, and service was terrible, but I chalked it up to it being busy there. Today there was no excuse.\n\nI walked up to grab a bottle of water so I could break my $20.  The location was empty, and the girl behind the counter was finishing up with the only other customer, moving at the speed of molasses.\n\nI step up to the counter with my prepackaged goods, and she doesn\'t even look at me. Now I\'m a 5\'10" blonde woman with shoulders my brothers should have had, so I\'m hard to miss. So I give her a friendly "hi!" just to make sure she knows I\'m there. She\'s still looking down, smashing her rolled coins against the cash register. My being in a rush doesn\'t make all of this ANY easier.\n\nFinally she casually says "is that it?", not exerting the extra effort to even look at me.  I say yeah with my money already ready. She rings me up and I provide exact change to try to make it faster to get my bills back. \n\nOf course one of her girlfriends shows up and she\'s gabbing away at her, with my $20 in her hand, waving it around as they talk about their weekend. I didn\'t want to blow up so I tried to be patient. She finally gets to counting out my change, and it takes her over 45 seconds to pull out a 10, a 5, and a 1. Are u serious? She never looked at me once or even smiled at me. If I didn\'t need the change I\'d have taken back my 20$ and left.\n\nThe worst part was NO ONE was behind me! Give me customer service, get rid of me quickly, then do whatever the hell you want!!!!!  Jesus christ!!! The receipt says Tawanda, so if you are a manager reading this, I highly recommend learning what Apple trains for customer service and teach it to your crew. In general I like what Cosi has to offer - simple, healthy, delicious food. This Cosi in particular has, without a doubt, the best staff. Every time I have come here they are welcoming and patient. They go above and beyond the what is required to accommodate specific needs and requests.\n\nI will always appreciate the warmth with which their staff treats me!! While I waited for my soup I watched one of the staff members while he worked making a sandwich. He had a large beard with no beard cover. He repeatedly wiped his runny nose on his bare wrist and forearm. Most people would have left but I was getting soup so I figured it was safe. The good news is that it was free of chin pubes and snot. The bad news is they only filled the large soup cup 3/4 of the way. Worst latte ever. Tastes like old milk and no espresso. When I went to get my money back, they couldn\'t get a manager. The short: pretty standard as far as Cosi\'s go. Ya always know what you\'re going to get. \n\nThe longer: conveniently located in the 30th street station, this Cosi has some seating area, free wifi & a stocked to-go counter. \n\nAre the tables sticky? Yes. Was the service mediocre? Yes. Was I excited to GTFO of the train station? Yes. But, I was fed & got wifi\'d up... so I\'m happy! 10 mins for hot water and 2 bags of tea.\n+ 20 mins for s\'mores.\n---------------------------\n   30 mins to complete our order = never again.\n\nThere were roughly 5 couples in the restaurant.\n\nWhat the heck? I empathize with the Eagles losing and all...but this is horrible. Everyone knows Cosi\'s food is sub-par. If you\'re looking for s\'mores and a good hot drink, make sure to bring a good read while you wait. Ordered a breakfast sandwich from Cosi for the first and last time.  I ordered a santa fe on a plain squagel.  the first thing i notice is some type of white crumbled substance on the sandwich.  turns out those were the egg whites, I didn\'t ask for egg whites, but the bigger problem is the use of an \'egg product\'  I think establishments should make it clear that their eggs come from a carton not from shells.  Furthermore there wasn\'t a good balance between the square bagel and the sandwich content, it\'s waaayyy too much bread for the small amount of filling. After three bites I tossed the sandwich Got really sick for two days after eating a salad from here. I would never eat here again!!! Cosi sandwiches are quite tasty... and extremely overpriced. The sesame ginger chicken and the hummus & fresh veggies are my two favorite choices upon discovering the exorbitant calories that lurk behind the \'Melt\' sandwiches. The tuna melt alone delivers 874 calories -- no wonder it tasted so good.\n\nSalads and espresso drinks generally follow the trend of overpriciness that Cosi shamelessly advocates. $10 for bird food? Umm no, sorry. The same holds true for the drip coffee; a medium sized is more expensive than a Starbucks venti?! The salads are not much better than a Panera\'s and the espresso drinks not as strong as the Starbucks either.\n\nI\'ve never seen this Cosi packed, which makes it a rather awkward place to, say, if you were to catch up with a friend or even study (not that the music or the loudness of the place is conducive to learning to begin with.) And as a side note, be sure to read those Terms of Service before logging on to the WiFi network! Horrible experience at 30th at station. Will never return. \n\n1. I ordered a small Tuscan chicken sandwich. They charged me for a large. I pointed this out and they took forever to grudgingly fix it. \n\n2. If you want a hot sandwich, they quote an additional 8 min wait time.\n\n3. I opened my sandwich on the train and they had given me A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SANDWICH than what I had ordered. My receipt had the sandwich listed correctly. \n\nIncompetence at its finest. I\'ve definitely experienced better. The food here is very mediocre, and on top of that, they were recently shut down by the health department for violations for storing food at improper temperatures, and lack of proper sanitation when handling food. I\'m surprised I haven\'t gotten sick yet, but it is Cosi after all. The food isn\'t amazing, but for the price, you get what you pay for. Overpriced bread and sandwiches in my opinion.The guy who works there who asks the riddles is quite cool though, he keeps me coming back. Service here is crap. I mean, I love Cosi. And usually they are very on top of things and hospitable. But this location is appalling. First of all, it took a long enough time of me standing around in their cluttered waiting area waiting to be called over to a register. The girl ringing me up (not wearing a name tag) just automatically assumed I wanted only the water bottle I was holding. So I ordered a melt sandwich and she then assumed what type of bread and side I wanted without asking. And before I could say I wanted white bread, she just up and walked away in the middle of my order! Another girl had to come finish ringing me up. Incredible. Then the melt wasn\'t even melted and cold in the middle. I definitely don\'t recommend this location. The employees either aren\'t getting paid enough or they just plain don\'t care. I am so not a Cosi fan.\nThe bread tastes like stale cardboard a minute after it cools - and g-d know what its doing inside my stomach.\n\nThe prices are high as are the caloric contents.\n\nThis particular location - inside 30th Street - is often crowded and the service is awful.\n\nNot my thing, baby - and 2 stars is being nice. Out of the many times I\'ve gone to this Cosi, I can count on one hand the number of times the staff there has gotten my order correct. They are always missing something, or accidentally giving my order to someone else, etc. However, the staff is always very polite and apologetic, so I can\'t be mad. Plus, I do really like the food better than the alternative (Au Ban Pain). Could vomit. I got the hummus and veggie sandwich since I am a vegetarian. Everything was going great until I got to the middle of my sandwich and I FOUND A RANDOM PIECE OF CHICKEN. C-H-I-C-K-E-N!!!!!!!!! I was already having a horrible day then to bite into a piece of chicken. GAG GAG GAG!!!!! I had to throw out my entire $13 sandwich then I HAD TO ENDURE FOUR HOURS OF CROWDED TRAINS WITHOUT ANY FOOD IN ME. I AM NOT HAPPY. I will avoid cosi in the future. I bought two sanwiches, a turkey blt and a shrimp Ceasar. Instead of shrimp cosi gave chicken. I would have tried to fix the order but my train was boarding in a couple of minutes. The sanwich reminiscent of putting a chicken Ceasar salad on hard bread. The turkey blt was better, the bread was fresher and the sanwich was correct. Cosi just isn\'t for me. Yummy sandwiches and bowls...quick but a little hard to figure out the menu. A much better, updated version of Au Bon Pain, occupying the niche that Au Bon Pain once held of the quality alternative sandwich place, but with a few extras (flatbread pizza, breakfast sandwiches). It\'s decent, and I appreciate fresh and crunchy vegetables in a sea of hoagies and burger fare, but the execution is missing a certain something I find it hard to put a finger on. That said, there\'s an actual Au Bon Pain still hanging on here at 30th street, and I heartily recommend passing that by and coming forty feet further down the corridor to get to Cosi. Location is important. This Cosi wouldn\'t survive if it weren\'t in the middle of a very busy train station, because of its inconsistent food products, poor customer service, long wait times, and messy eating areas. Thankfully, thousands of first-timers and Cosi-loving suckers in need of caffeine (like me) are literally trained in hourly.  \n\nI frequently take Amtrak to my company\'s corporate office in Philadelphia, and inevitably have to get up at o\'dark-thirty to do so.  This Cosi has managed to make even the simplest of coffee orders painful to the point that, now when I stop, I just grab the pre-made half tea, half lemonade drinks. I still have to wait in short lines that move at a glacial pace and pay some of the most unfriendly, unhappy looking workers I\'ve ever met, but at least my drink tastes good. Since a lot of the places around me are closed by the time I get back every week, I\'ve reluctantly decided to eat at Cosi. I\'ve found service to be much faster here than at other Cosi\'s.  One of the cashiers is friendly. I think it\'s because I\'m really cute...or maybe she\'s just a friendly person. \n\nTaking it down a couple stars because they sometimes run out of ingredients to make what I order. That\'s unacceptable for a chain! I had a smoothie and my husband had a spinach florentine omelet while waiting for a train. Yes, it was somewhat expensive for the size of the portions, but the young man behind the register who took my order was very polite and the service was prompt. I also like that they have the calorie counts on the menu. Their lattes are really good. I tried their tbm sandwich and i did not care for it... something just seemed off in the taste and i felt a little nauseous afterwards. They also have really good lemonade, and the people that work at the 30th st. Station location are so charming! Tasty, uniquely built sandwiches that were probably made to put your tastebuds on fire...in a good way I promise. I got the chicken TBM and it was good. It has a Dijon mustard/dressing which made the tomato/mozzarella/basil and chicken taste so good. Towards the middle of the sandwich I noticed that it was getting a little spicy...not tongue burning spice, but clear your sinus up spice. I thought it was a horseradish sauce and not a vinaigrette/mustard. I was very happy with it, and ended up ordering a cosi club sandwich for the road. \n\nGreat service and great staff :) If you\'re a vendor at a train station, or any transportation center for that matter..wouldn\'t you think the majority of your clientele would be people ON THE GO?!?  You would think service would be speedier but no.  This Cosi is way too slow.  \n\nI wanted to pick up a sandwich before I caught my train.  Waiting on my sandwich almost made me miss my train.  \n\nService fail.  And looking at the nutritional value, food is fail too. I love anything tandoori. So naturally I was intrigued by Cosi\'s tandoori chicken sandwich. Let\'s just say it was a huge disappointment. The bread was so tough for one. But forget the bread. The chicken is what\'s important and it tasted like imitation tandoori. What a let down. I did pick up a couple chocolate chip cookies and those were delicious! DON\'T GO HERE! Worst vendor at 30th Street. As an employee in the building I try to support all of the vendors, but after 3 years I have yet to have a good experience here and don\'t plan to ever go back. Today was the last straw. I ordered a simple cup of oatmeal. 10 minutes later I asked where my order was and the girl gave me the cup that I had watched sit on the counter for 9 of those 10 minutes. And then she tried to tell me they had just put it on the counter. On top of that, the girl at the register failed to tell me when I ordered brown sugar with my oatmeal, that the oatmeal condiments are self serve. So imagine what a jerk I sounded like when I complained that my oatmeal didn\'t have brown sugar in it! It\'s too bad, because they really do make a good oatmeal, but I\'ll have to try the one at Au Bon Pain. Save yourself the aggravation and check out any other place at 30th Street. Horrible service. When calling to place our order the person on the phone answered in the middle of cursing. When picking up our order, the workers were yelling at each other, not paying attention and our pizza was cold. I would never go to this location again. After running errands all morning, I did not feel like cooking & remember seeing if you order online, pizza is half off. I thought this was a great idea/deal. I picked up my order or a large pizza & mozzarella sticks. I only live a few min away but when I went to sit down and eat the pizza was barely warm & the mozzarella sticks were not even really cooked. I try to stay away from chain pizza places but couldn\'t pass up on such a good deal. Next time I know not order from here again. It\'s delivery Pizza Hut, so what can you expect? Nice employees but Yelp is meant for small businesses, not corporations. Shop local and get pizza from New England or, better yet, Vince\'s. You\'ll be glad you didn\'t go down the wrong road. This pizza is gross. The toppings are dry and salty. Pizza wasn\'t hot. Undercooked. The ingredients tasted old. It took 2 hours to arrive. Even the stuffed crust was soggy. Disappointed at this pizza slut. Like ALL pizza places- extra cheese is NEVER really EXTRA cheese. Sadly, nobody wants to really address this issue. Stop over cooking my pizza please! If I want it well done- I will ask for it well done!  The staff needs to ck that all of the order is there. If I pay for extra sauces I expect the one that comes with it and the one I am paying for to be there. Get the round garlic bread with cheese on the menu ASAP! I am all for giving people a break, so I\'ll try and do that here.\n\nOur first experience with THIS store, and it was horrible. Ordered online, went to pickup and it wasn\'t ready, not even close!\n\nOn arrival - I noticed alot of people waiting.. the phones were ringing off the hook, nobody at the counter, took 10 minutes for me to get someone\'s attention!\n\n Waited another 1/2 hour, finally got the BIG dinner box and left. \n\nGot the pizza home, everything was cold! So I waited for a cold pizza? We had to reheat everything before we ate it, and the breadsticks were actually dry!?\n\nI might give them a 2nd try before I write them off, but really... I\'m thinking we\'ll order from a local pizza joint before going here again. While it might be more$, I bet you Sal\'s pizza (e.g. - any neighborhood pizza place) would run circles around this place.\n\n-Dissatisfied Customer I personally didn\'t think the food was bad, like the other reviews said. I order about once every two weeks and their pizza was not bad, especially hand tossed one.  The wings are nice too, like the boneless wings.  I tried breadsticks as well which was decent.  Pizza was average . Obviously it\'s nowhere near the best, but it\'s okay .  however the service was nice.  Once I got a wrong pizza and they nicely replaced it and also gave me a credit on the next order. Very bad experiences waited for a pizza more than 45 min. Even tho they didn\'t make it , finally I cancelled my order.  Never go back . As my first visit to the store was pretty poor, I complained to PH corporate. I got a standard response back, saying that the owner would contact me. That didn\'t happen until I wrote back (2x) and I did end up getting a phone call (cool!) from this store\'s owner.\n\nHe was a really nice guy, apologized for my experience, and he ended up refunding me for my whole 1st purchase with him. So that weekend I ordered a carryout pizza with the amount he credited me for.\n\nEverything was hot and fresh, and my family was happy. In the end, that\'s all I really wanted. The pizza was "as ordered" and was still hot when I got it home and put it on the table.\n\nI will go back and order from them again, my faith in Pizza Hut restored. -Ordered a supreme pan pizza online delivery.\n-Received a hand tossed supreme pizza (crust like frozen pizza. Handtossed=bad) \n-Called and manager said they ran out off "pan pizzas" and they meant to call me but didnt.\n- Offered me a $5 coupon\n- Fuck pizza hut. I love Pizza Hut, unfortunately this Pizza Hut doesn\'t know how to follow directions. There have been times where I order 30 MINUTES IN ADVANCE, and still have ended up waiting another 30 within in the shop for it. I have gotten pizza with buffalo sauce on it, pizza that tasted like mush and my coworker once got wings that weren\'t thoroughly cooked. How do you mess up wings? Customer service is kind of crap, regardless of the night pizza takes at least an hour to show up. Mind you they are 10 minutes away.... Ordered one pizza online and went to pick it up more than an hour later. It still isnt ready. Terrible, I should have just cooked it myself. I like Pizza Hut but this is my first time ordering from this location and it was the worse. The girl on the phone taking our order was yelling at her coworkers asking if they deliver to our stay. She could\'ve put us on hold to do that. When our order finally arrive...... our supreme pizza looked like the driver dropped it and the cheese sticks had no cheese at all on it. I will not order from Pizza Hut after this. Just sad. They don\'t speak or welcome you when you walk in. This is not the cleanest place, but it could be much worse. They did still have up their cheap Memorial Day decor on Father\'s Day. The food do come out in a timely manner and was great! I love pizza hut and they\'re great this one sucks i asked for garlic sauce they gave me marinara sauce instead and i paid for it never again will i order from this location!! I ordered food last night on November 18,2016 they told me 20min. After an hour I called back 2times no answer and they never showed with my order I ordered an hour before they close if their were a problem they should have told me they could not deliver instead if having a good customer sit around and wait. Thanks for nothing pizza hut Basically like any other pizza Hut. But seems this one has the heat on in winter up to blast with on top of ovens going making pizza.. I can\'t only image what the electric bill is. \n\nNever has a complaint when comes to the food being done on time. Always hot and ready. Make sure to order online. get the better specials. Then you do if you order inside store or over the phone. \n\nThe people that work hear are pretty nice. If you don\'t get hear by time food is done they keep it in a little hot oven to keep it warm. So that\'s kinda cool. Always enjoyed the wings and pizza. And the pasta. Not so much the breadsticks. But like the full menu with so much options and not just pizza. \n\nThe parking lot is a total disaster. So drive at you\'re own risk. And look in every direction when entering and leaving pizza hut. DISGUSTING! Went there a few weeks ago after work with a friend of mine to pick up a $20 dinner box. I was standing near the counter talking to a friend when I noticed the guy prepping the food was barehanding all the ingredients (mind you, he had long hair that wasn\'t even tied back.) I call for the manager and tell them I would like my money back (I have an OCD with food) and he claims he can\'t (even though I paid cash!) He tries to reassure me he would remake the food while the other food prep guy ran his hands across the dirty counter. They go back to the back and I hear them obnoxiously ridiculing me for having an issue with a stranger that looked unkempt touching my food with his bare hands! At this point I\'m watching "barehand prepper" (I\'ll refer to him as BP) like a hawk to see if he ends up touching my food and he\'s back there back at it touching more of the ingredients/food without any gloves on and he had not even washed his hands since touching the dirty counters!!! \n\nI call for the manager again and demand my money back, and he keeps refusing. He claims he can only give me a credit with my phone number attached that could only be used at their Pizza Hut. At this point, I don\'t ever want to eat at this Pizza Hut again so I don\'t understand how that would resolve anything. He keeps making claims why they can\'t reimburse me so I call Pizza Hut customer service to find out that they should be able to reimburse me if the food isn\'t taken and that they should be wearing gloves. They (this branch) continue to waste my time (it had been well over 40 minutes at this point) and take other customers rather than diffuse the situation with me, and they tell me they applied I credit I could use at another Pizza Hut (which I find out wasn\'t true.) I\'m exhausted and hungry, after I worked a long shift at work, so I just take it and head to another Pizza Hut 10 minutes away. I speak to the manager there and they told me 100% they can reimburse me in those type of scenarios and that they should have been wearing gloves. As I mention this, she had her food prep person come out the back and he already had gloves on even then. \n\nAt this point, I\'m fed up when I find out I couldn\'t even use that fake credit they claimed they applied and their manager tells me I could 100% go back and get my money so I go back to have more of my time wasted. They call the owner and the owner comes in there and is rude about the entire situation, still trying to hold back from my money. I begin to make a scene and they try to make it seem like I\'m crazy for not wanting some dirty looking stranger touching my food with their bare hands. Finally, an hour and a half after I first stepped into this DISGUSTING DESPICABLE Pizza Hut, she finally reimbursed me the cash and I left. \n\nNEVER AGAIN! They should be shut down.\n\nhttp://www.phila.gov/health/pdfs/Food_Regulations.pdf\n\nThis is proof they are supposed to be wearing gloves if they are touching food. I have yet to receive a call from the district manager, like I was promised. Located in a seedy area. Store was dirty and run down. I was hungry and craving Pizza Hut so I didn\'t care. I was told they ran out of personal pan pizzas. Girl behind the counter was rude. In and Out is the worst neighborhood take out place in West Oak Lane. I ordered breakfast (I know lol) from them about a month ago, and received pancakes that were drenched in some weird butter substance and home fries that were rock hard. I spoke to a man named Tommy, who offered all kinds of excuses about the food before finally offering me a credit. \n\nFast forward to this morning. I decided to give them another chance because I was hungry and had a credit. I call and am greeted by a young woman who informed me that I had two people waiting before me and asked me to hold. She proceeded to place me on hold before I could even respond. I held for about 3 minutes before she picked up. I placed my order and then explained that I had a credit. She stated she would need to look in "the book" for my credit. Another two minutes of waiting and surprise, she can\'t locate my credit. I ask to speak to a manager, and she says that the manager is out doing deliveries. Seriously...wth? She tells me I can call back later. Umm no, I\'m hungry now.\n\nI ended up canceling my order. This place is beyond ratchet and I will never order from them again. The food at Bruno\'s and Bally\'s is much better...so is their level of cleanliness and customer service. I watch the food preparer cough up a lung over the pizza he was making and never covered his mouth. Absolutely mortified and will never order from here again.  STAY AWAY unless you like the saliva and germs from your food prepared baked into your pizza. The food is great though, but I won\'t be returning. I ordered from them tonight. They usually have good pizza. Tonight I had delivery and it took over an hour to be delivered. They got my pizza order wrong. I also ordered a cheese steak and fries. The steak barely had any meat on it and the fries tasted as though they were left over from the night before and reheated and delivered to me. Bottom line I give this place two thumbs down and probably won\'t be ordering from them again. And to top it off when they were called back about how long the order  and how the food was, the person who answered had he nerve to get an attitude instead of hearing out the customer. Two thumbs down I ordered the bacon cheesesteaks. The cheesesteaks were a good size and still warm by the time I got back home. I prefer the onions to be cooked a tad more for fried onions. Might be best to go without or request for them to be really sautéed. I loved the bread it was hearty and fresh. There was ample meat and crisp bacon. I really enjoyed the neatness of the sandwich it was easy to hold and bite. Be prepared for a good quality meat I believed they used chopped sirloin; a really Philly cheesesteak. If I could give no stars I would!\n\nDon\'t patronize this place. I dunno if they got new management or whatever, but we used to order from them in the past with fast and hot food--no issues!! We ordered from them about a month ago for the first time in a while. I ordered my wrap TOLD THEM HOW I WANTED it! When it was delivered, it was how THE MENU says it comes (Chicken, lettuce, onions--I\'m allergic to onions), I ONLY wanted (which I told in detail) CHICKEN, CHEESE LETTUCE & EXTRA PICKLES--not hard to do right?!! I called them surprisingly the counter girl seemed concerned, but I got no help from the manager who didn\'t have enough balls to even get on the phone to help resolve the problem. The response to why I didn\'t have pickles on my sandwich and that I was allergic to onions and cannot eat what I paid for --WHEN YOU ORDER YOU HAVE TO TELL US WHAT YOU ---DONT WANT ON THE SANDWICH--NOT WHAT YOU WANT. ???? Dumbfounded by the idiotic response, because I TOLD YOU how I wanted it which will in turn show you WANT I DONT WANT...I asked how they will resolve it, "we will give you a new one next time you order" -_- Not that they would make me a new one---NEXT TIME! \n\nSo I said --Fine!! I\'ll hang up, call and order it and use my COMPED WRAP--- I\'m put on hold. She comes back and says no HE SAYS that next time you order you won\'t be charged for pickles -___- not a FREE wrap. Wow! I was so blown I just hung up.\n\nAsk me whyyyyy I decided to order from them again today, for delivery. I ordered THE WAY THEY TOLD ME HOW I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED LAST TIME. Order done.......I wait....BOOM --Delivery comes....I see a wrap---CHEESE STEAK WRAP!!!!! -___- \n\nI\'m done with this place, currently waiting on my resend of my wrap--which was correct on the slip. Let see how this goes. I may snap on these idiots if they can\'t deliver my basic wrap. I\'m not asking for much! I just want what I ordered and what I paid for--is that hard???  Don\'t order from here The self proclaimed "day time cashier manager" aka the COUNTER GIRL was extremely rude and condescending today when I called about my incorrect order. I ordered a steak, onion and green pepper omelet. It CLEARLY says that it is served WITH home fries, toast, butter and jelly. I called to inform her that I didn\'t receive the home fries. She was very rude saying that it doesn\'t say that home fries are included. Last time I checked the word WITH means to be included. When I pointed out that she was being rude she hung up on me. Personally I feel that she was mad at the fact that someone pointed out her illiteracy... Oh well c\'est la vie! IF I COULD TAKE AWAY 5 STARS ....I WOULD GIVE A DOUBLE NEGATIVE 5\n\nBeen trying to resolve an unhappy purchase dated back to June 5, 2015 each time i call Mohamed "the manager" isn\'t available. I later found out that he was not the manager so i don\'t know who the true owner or manager is. \nI Ordered takeaway totaling $30.  they charged for the  3 meals but delivered 2.  i called back to ask and they said oh we forgot. I wait another hour after waiting the first 1hr for first delivery "no food". I called back again. Finally the 3rd food item arrived 2 hours later. \nI asked for a refund for the poor food and service and either you sit on hold for 15-20 mins EVERYDAY  or you are chasing people with nasty attitudes\n\nI WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU GO ELSEWHERE THEY SUCK!!!! My girlfriend and I love the pizza here! We\'ve been customers for about a year now and they consistently serve good pizza (added benefit that we also get to support local business). We tend to be wary of trying new pizza places but my younger brother recommended. When I entered the aroma of fresh pizza was a good sign. We devoured our personal pepperoni in the car and went back the next night for a large. Their pizza is on par with other greek pizza places I\'ve been too - New Station (Hunting Park), Overbrook (City Line Ave), Princes Pizza (Algon Ave). I can solidly give them a 5/5. Great sauce, good cheese that\'s not overpowering, and a slightly charred crust that\'s heavy. They have some seating in the back but we always eat in the car. Not sure about their delivery - they always looked swamped so I\'d drive in and pick up. Give them about 20 minutes I called my order in and it was ready on time(great)! When I got to the store the lady at the counter was Very rude! Her attitude was written on her face and also came out of her mouth! I really Almost turned right around and walked out! But Hunger prevailed! So I stayed and took my food home! Fortunately for me the food was good! So basically me in this please have a like/dislike relationship. I like the food but I dislike the service pick your poison The ladies who take the orders  leave u on hold forever have attitude problem there food is pretty good because of there customers service i m ordering frim there The cheese pizza was horrible. Tasted like expired cheese had been put on top and baked .i asked with a garden salad with spinach instead of iceberg. Instead simply tell me they don\'t make a substitute they places cooked spinach on top. Never again thanks but no thanks We only order the pizza and wings.\n\nThe person who takes the order is usually rushed, but gets all the info and is fairly pleasant.  The food itself has always been good.  The pizza crust isn\'t too thin and has the right amount of sauce and cheese.  The wings have a lot of meat and little to no fat. The last couple of times the wings and pizza were a little undercooked.  I don\'t mind waiting a couple more minutes to have it cooked to perfection.\n\nThe last time I ordered they charged a fee to take a payment over the phone, a delivery fee, and of course I gave a tip to the driver.  I think all that was $7-$8 just to order delivery.  That is what will make me think twice before ordering. I ordered $30.00 of food, and the fries where old looking. I also ordered a quantity of 24 buffalo wings. I called about my blue cheese. I was told that they refuse to bring it to me !! I live 10 mins away, I have bought food from them for 15 years !! I was told that the owner Mike will not care !! lastly told by a staff member she has seen them do things to people food !! I wished I read the reviews before I ordered. This place is appalling. I waited over 1hour 1/2 for my food to be delivered, and they didn\'t even get the order correct or delivered all of my items.  I spent about $30. When I called, the counter girl (rude and nasty) past the phone to who I think was a manager. He said it was nothing they could do. Wait, what!  I will be canceling the charge off of my credit card. I hope this place closes down.  They suck! Do yourself a favor, DON\'T ORDER HERE. Please do not patronize this business ever.\nI called because their was a mistake with my order and the manager begins cussing at me and claiming she spit in my food. Will be reporting to health department but since it is the night before thanksgiving that can\'t happen until Monday at very least. This is a new business, good food and Fast service.  They do charge an extra dollar when you use your credit card.  They have 25 flavors of ice cream.And the most items I ever saw on a menu. I had the cheesesteak, it was okay the steak seasoning was good but it wasn\'t very cheesy. I was expecting to have my mind blown. I would go here for a decent cheesesteak but not an amazing cheesesteak The food was amazing! I ordered wings, pizza, and hoagies for a (football) party i was hosting and everyone loved the food. The girl on the phone when I was ordering was very nice and got all the information quick and easy, making my life a lot smoother. The wings had a lot of meat on them and they tasted delicious! The hoagies were very fresh and one of the best in Philly. The pizza was very tasty with the right amount of sauce, cheese and crust! I definitely recommend this place for hosting an event or just getting some lunch/ and dinner!! Called to order and I couldn\'t even get through the order without them being rude. Told them never mind and went somewhere else. That was today.\n\nLast week I ordered and it took over an hour and a half to get the delivery. Too bad because I actually like the food but they don\'t deserve my money. The food Is very good service not so much. They get my order wrong literally every time I\'ve  ordered (and I\'ve ordered at least 8 times from this restaurant) I\'m  being merciful by giving three stars. This store is the worst they do not know how to handle the pressure of being busy they continuously lie to customers about wait time they have to respect for customers they talk to them any kind of way and also they were not wearing any gloves during the pandemic while handling food I ordered tonight, 2 chicken cheesesteak, and 4 steak hoagies, buy the time I got home the food was cold, chicken was burned, the condiments were wrong no one was happy with food it was the worst!!!!!!!! Terrible I wish I actually READ these reviews before I attempted to place my order this morning smh. I called this morning before 10 a.m. to place an order, in the mist of me placing my order I was placed on a long hold, then hung up on. I called back. No answer. So I placed my order with the one other restaurant open that early. Ms. Ester\'s. Well, the counter girl/woman placed an order and sent it to my place anyway. I received a phone call thinking it was my delivery for Ester\'s. I went down and grabbed the food. By the time I only grabbed the home fries out (I was starving ). I kept smelling something yucky but assumed it was near smoke, literally 5 minutes later I got a call from Ester\'s saying my food was here. I said you guys already delievered, that\'s when I check my bag, and it was back with all the foods I don\'t eat (I\'m Vegan). Pork, Grits swimming in butter, french toast etc. I was LIVID. I called the delivery guy back and he said to call the counter girl. I couldn\'t pin point the number so I called the delivery guy back to confirm the number several times. No answer. Mind you, I called to place my order before 10 am. I had been calling non-stop since 10:40 a.m. I left voicemail msgs. No response. I finally decided to go back in my call log and start calling numbers. The bag had no menu, no number, no info. I finally reach the restaurant. I call and ask is this a restaurant. Before I could get an answer, I was placed on hold. I get placed on hold, and then she picks up again, and asks may I take your order, I ask, whom am I speaking with, she says hold on again???? She finally picks up and says her name is Allison. I explain how the order was never placed, and it was completely wrong, and I would like a refund minus the things I opened (homefries and orange juice). She said I did place an order and she confirmed the amount with me. I said you never confirmed anything with me, because you hung up the phone and when I called back, I didn\'t get an answer which made me call the only other establishment open. Well, she kept putting me on hold, and said that\'s what I order and I wasn\'t charged for the bacon so I got free bacon. I told her I don\'t eat bacon, I would have ordered regular toast NOT french toast (which I actually ordered and got from Ester\'s). Well, she starts screaming on top of me talking, saying she has the slip, and it\'s what I ordered and she confirmed it, and I paid for what I ordered. Then she says I need to call tomorrow to speak with the manager and the cook was out for the day.. (mind you it\'s after 1 pm.). So, I said it\'s not their fault, you processed an ordered and sent food to me I NEVER ordered. Then every time I went to explain to her to re-trace her steps she starts yelling CALL THE MANAGER TOMORROW, YOU\'LL HAVE TO CALL THE MANAGER TOMORROW, CALL THE MANAGER TOMORROW, BUH BYE, BUH BYE. *CLICK*. I call back and I get the deliver guy, I said I am calling on a recorded line (since I ordered through grub hub) and I hope Grub Hub gets this entire conversation, Allison is rude and extremely unprofessional, I will NEVER order food from this place ever again, I will make sure everyone knows how unprofessional and RUDE this establishment is. The guy says, ma\'am I apologize, do you still have the food, I will refund you the balance of what you didn\'t eat and take back the rest of the food. I received a refund of $7 out of my $13 order (which is fair, considering I did eat the homefries and opened the orange juice.) I will NEVER order from the place again NEVER. I will call the manager early in the a.m. to let him know about Allison rude self smh. I like their veggie pizza.  We thought we\'d change it up so I ordered 2 items tonight: fish n chips for a friend and chef salad for myself.  The order took 45 min to get there. Ok. The fish was 4 smallish fish fingers with minced fish inside.  Flavorless. The fries were soggy.  My friend tried 1 piece and then threw the rest away. The chef salad was mine and looked good but they forgot the salad dressing so I\'ll need to buy some salad dressing tomorrow.  Looking forward to lunch tomorrow .  Will stick with veggie pizza at the place from now on. Good food but they always mess up a order.\nJust today I ordered a small pepperoni pizza with light cheese. When I get to the store they ask me what did I order I told them the cashier opens my pizza box and says the put ground beef on it. I said but that\'s not what I ordered, she say we ran out of pepperoni, so I ask why not give me a call and let me know that. No answer of course.. You would think that since the dynamic duo of inconsideration that I live with are ALWAYS ordering food, they would have better taste in takeout places. But you suck! They should\'ve ordered from BALLYS, a few blocks down. Anyway, the burger was tacky & cold with a bun that looked like it was thrown in the trash & stepped on- both buns mushy, top bun w/some of the sesame seeds torn out, and bottom bun falling apart. Ridiculous! I called and was immediately placed on hold for like 3 minutes. It was around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, so they were probably extremely busy. Ordered a large beef pepperoni pizza and it was really good. It took about an hour for delivery, which sucks but understandable, and the pizza was still warm. I want to give less than one star.  This evening at approximately 6:15 pm my cousin and I ordered a stromboli, wings and a chicken steak NO CHEESE with salt, pepper, ketchup\' and fried onions.  40 minutes into our wait, I overheard one of the workers ask the cashier what were we waiting for and she told him. It was obvious that we were overlooked.  Another 15 minutes passed and I asked about the order and was told 4 more minutes.  Finally we get the order and I confirm that the steak has no cheese. The cook can\'t remember if he put cheese on it or not, so I open it and find CHEESE on it.  They make another, the cook mumbles something that I can\'t understand and I repeat that there should be salt, pepper, ketchup, fried onions and NO CHEESE.  My bad for not checking it until I got home. I open it and find that it had what I thought was cheese. I call IN and Out and they tell me it\'s mayo. I never asked for mayo. I told them that I wanted them to deliver the sandwich that I ordered an hour and half ago and that they got wrong twice. The person puts on me on hold so that she can call the owner to get it delivered.  After several minutes a man gets on the phone and tells me that he\'ll give me credit for next time. #1 Next time???? Do you really think that I\'ll ever be back there and #2 what am I supposed to do for tonight.  He tells me one of his car is inoperable and the one driver he has doesn\'t know his way around (well then why is he driving and why don\'t you get him a phone with google maps!). I told him that I want my sandwich and I wasn\'t coming to get it. The person slams the phone in my ear.  It\'s been about 20 minutes and I\'m still trying to calm down.  Rude, inept, and no customer service at this establishment. I WILL NOT  be ordering from them again. I don\'t deal with disrespect on any level when I\'m spending my money. The foods not that good either. Got food delivered from here recently and it was delicious. However, the delivery person has an attitude. I requested that they call when they got at the door, he rang the door bell and told me he called 4 times like I\'m the blame. ..my phone was next to me a full hour prior up until he got to my home and I never once received a call from anyone.\n\nAs I\'ve said though, the food was amazing. Every time I make a trip back home to Philly, I always have to stop here to take some cheesesteaks back to VA. I can honestly say I\'ve never had an issue here and they pack my food to travel perfectly! Food was fantastic I ordered mozzarella sticks it was good for a reasonable price and they also had a lamb Gyro which was pretty tasty first time eating there I recommend others to go great customer service I was very disappointed at this restaurant. The man making the pizza was working hard. I can\'t say the same for the rest of the workers. My winds were ready on arrival. I had to wait an additional 30 minutes for my pizza. So guess what. My wings were cold and the kids complained that the pizza was salty. Yup , salty. I tasted the same thing. I will never order food from here against The food here is great...however, Moustafa or whatever his name is needs to do better at hiring the chicks that answer the phone. They are rude and totally lack respect for the customer. I will never order here again just because of that...I don\'t want any nasty bi&ch\'s handling my food! I just order pizza and hot wings from hear. HORRIBLE !! My wings didn\'t even have sauce on them and the blue cheese that came with it tasted old. They are usually better than this but they really fell off. The absolute worst. My order was placed at 3:55 pm It was delivered at 5:37. I called and spoke to Allison to say I was unhappy with the food. It was cold and there was barley a piece of fish within the bread. She began to yell and said the manager won\'t be in until after 12 tomorrow to give a refund he is the only one who can. Just don\'t eat the food. NEVER EVER ORDER FROM HERE. Worst food ever! Customer service is horrible! Burger King is an okay alternative to Mcdonalds. 6/10 Would recommend but idk about coming again. Worst Burger King on Earth. There will be something guaranteed to be wrong during your visit--taste,wait,food temperature or overall cleanliness--you name it.  I know it\'s the only fast food place on the block, but just don\'t. I know, what should I expect from a rundown Burger King at 8th & Market? But today\'s experience was really beyond pathetic. \n\nI waited for 20 minutes this morning for my simple order of 2 breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. The workers showed no interest at all in helping customers or making food. The cashier took an order, then slouched off to do something in the back, no apologies. The line extended to the door. \n\nI could see in the kitchen they were slowly cooking a couple items, and frying a small basket of hash browns. With the number of people in line they should have had a double order of everything on the grill and been hustling to get it all done. \n\nIt took 10 minutes just to get to the cashier and place my order. Then I stood against a wall and waited another 10. I watched 6 people who were behind me in line get their food first. When I finally asked if they\'d skipped me they said "no your order is almost ready." But there was no reason mine should have taken longer. They were just apathetic, half asleep and verging on mean with their annoyance at customers who didn\'t come when their number was called. \n\nAfter all that, the sandwiches were sloppily put together, egg hanging out the sides, and wrapped with the inside of the wrapper on the outside. \n\nSo if by posting this I can get even ONE person to avoid this place, I will feel I\'ve done my job. This place is closed  the signs are off the building  and it looks  like the y are putting up drywall inside.  i don\'t know if it will reopen as  a BK or just office space. Staff were nice. A few homeless people come in and try to get some food once in a while. Be a kind person and buy someone something if you can. This has got to be the worst Burger King I\'ve ever been to. The service was normal, for what it\'s worth, but the burgers and fries tasted like ass and the whole place was filthy. I dropped my scarf on the floor and caught Hep C just picking it up. The place was full of homeless people refilling soda cups from other stores and crackheads staring bug-eyed at their fries, but I guess those people gotta eat too. This Burger King was made famous by the late City paper when a writer crashed his bike outside the door, and helpful employees brought out napkins to the injured.\n\nLocated immediately across from the Disney Hole, I would be lying if I did not say that many a time, I have gotten off at 8th Street El stop just for that charbroiled taste.  Oh, and also the spiral staircase.\n\nOnce I met a woman loitering there. She was of the Roma ethnicity. I told her that was cool, but she sharply retorted that "being a gypsy does not put money in your pocket." So I gave her a dollar and left more the wiser.\n\nThey now have an upstairs lounge.  I went up, hoping to see De La Soul kicking it with some BK honeys, but alas, I merely ate alone. This BK has been remodeled and is now considered a decent place to eat, especially from the way it looked 4 months ago. Thank goodness Philadelphia can sustain at least 1 Burger King in Center City, and one that isn\'t scary to patronize! 5 stars for this BK? Yes 5 stars for a BK! Allow me to explain. I\'ve been here a few times both times I witnessed events that compromised sterility that they could have been easily covered up to save $ but this place did things a mom and pop would probably never do. \n\nAfter a mopping a girl took out a box of straws. They dropped onto the floor. All still wrapped. She picked them all up and threw away probably 300+ straws. A customer commented that it seemed a waste. She kindly explained  it was illegal to keep anything that touched the floor. \n\nAnother time someone returned the wrong order, the gentleman behind the counter threw the food away. The customer whose order it was, said that he would take it rather than wait. The gentleman explained he could not do that, and all food had to be made fresh, despite the customer almost begging the worker to let him have his returned order. \n\nCombine that with the fact they never got my order wrong, and I can\'t rate them less than 5 stars. Sure sometimes the burgers are more charred than I would care for, but I\'ve never been served undercooked, unlike 5 guys. The prices are pretty high compared to other Burger King restaurants and the Whopper Jr I had was the tiniest one I\'ve ever eaten but I feel it\'s one of the tastiest I\'ve eaten, too. The little burger patty was so juicy. Good job here. The place has gotten a facelift in recent years so it looks pretty nice inside. The seating looks limited but remember there\'s a second floor, so that\'s a plus. The area is a little iffy at night, but for daytime excursions it\'s fine. STAY AWAY! I would never go to this Burger King again. Though it is 4-5 blocks from the signing of our important historical documents, in the morning of an August day in 2008 I saw people shooting up drugs outside this restaurant. Market Street is full of stores from 12th to 5th that are low class and those people are around and especially outside this Burger King. I am surprised that the management and workers do not call the police every morning when they see drug dealers and users outside the restaurant. Unfortunately, a family was there in the restaurant right after me. They chose to sit on one side of the restaurant and placed their children away from the windows. Great location but this place is in need  of an ambitious manager. The staff is friendly but extremely slow.. This is suppose to be Fast Food. It was late, it was cold, I was kinda craving something hot that was on my way to the train. This was right next to the PATCO stop.\n\nI haven\'t been in a Burger King in a while, so I opted for a Whopper Junior and asked for no onions and no ketchup, mustard, any of that.  I\'m pretty sure she heard me - I asked as she was ringing it up one more time, "No onions, no ketchup mustard, any of that, right?"  She enthusiastically nodded her head.\n\nWhat did I get I get? A Whopper Junior with everything on it. But I had read the reviews and saw that they throw away anything you return, so I just scraped off all the crap I didn\'t want.  \n\nFries were hot and good and free wifi. This place is pathetic,they only give u 30min to eat ur food,u need to have a receipt to go to the bathroom, the music is to loud, and they false advertise there food,there food gives u the runs, soda is very flat, they even have hard wood seats, This is the place that finally did it, the place that broke me. I used to swear by the Whopper and still love it but I\'ll never eat at another on in my city. All I wanted was a whopper with just ketchup and a hotdog with just ketchup. This is what I ordered, a complicated order I know. I will exaggerate nothing about this experience\n\nAttempt #1 I get a whopper with the works and a hot dog with the work, I return it\nAttempt #2 I get a whopper with cheese and mustard and a hot dog with the works, I return\nAttempt #3 I get a whopper with cheese and ketchup and a dog with no ketchup, I return\n\n*pause*\nNow the most damning thing about this experience actually wasn\'t the screw ups. Apparently its company policy that whenever food is returned its immediately thrown out. So they threw out about $50 of food because I couldn\'t get an order with just ketchup.\n\nAttempt #4 I got my order and someone else\'s. I return the other person\'s food and it goes right in the trash. This was when I tapped out. I ate my food, then swore to never set foot in the place again Poor service and never fully supplied. One day I wanted onion rings and they didn\'t have any then went two days later no ice cream, no cookies, they had onion rings but no sauce and I wasn\'t able to get chicken fingers. Worst store ever and service is slow No one seems to like their job here. AC was broken. Customer service horrendous. It shouldn\'t be expected to walk into a fast food restaurant and get bad service. Took 20 mins before I got my burger and fries. Overall, a bad experience. Everyone including manager and cashiers were hating life or something. Unfortunate. Middle-of-the-road as Burger Kings go. They\'re pretty busy, so the food is usually hot and doesn\'t sit around in the warmer too long, although the buns are often stale on Sundays and Mondays. The dining area is kept pretty clean, especially considering that people tend to linger, and the bathrooms are tolerable. The main downside is that *everything* except drink lids is kept behind the counter--you have to ask to get ketchup, salt, utensils, napkins...\n\nIN SUMMARY\nFood freshness: good except very late at night\nOrder accuracy: 95%\nOverall staff attitude: brusque but businesslike\nCleanliness of dining area: wiped down regularly\nCleanliness of bathrooms: average for fast food\nRefills on drinks: yes\nCondiments, napkins, utensils: behind counter\nKid\'s play area: no\nDrive-through: no What a chaotic place.  I witness a young lady on register take a kids order then leave the register before he could pay so she could go on break.  The fifteenth people behind me really loved that. This location is not a bad place. They are always busy and they try their best to serve you as efficient as possible. I go here once every two weeks on my cheat day. I enjoy the fact that they have kiosk available to the customers. This makes the visit quick and easy. Customer service has improved over the last few months which is always a plus. I\'ve never eaten at this bk but one time I was stuck at a light on 8th st and saw a middle aged man walking in with a lit cigarette in his mouth, his pants around his ankles and shit seeping through the back of his boxers and running down his legs. I\'d like to know how the employees handled that one. Do you shoot him? 3 stars? They would make you wait an whole hour just for your damn food. Never again\n Never again!!!! I haven\'t ordered here in so long and now I\'m like ha. Never again\n My kids waiting for me outside. Never again. Fast food where ???? They play around and not serious about there job I know it\'s fast food \nBut omg ... this place is ridiculous. \nYou wait a shorter time for a gourmet meal . \n\nThe employees were all just talking and complaining about how hard their job is while everyone was waiting for their burgers.\n\nBest to avoid \n\nIt\'s so bad it\'s laughable The interior was clean and cool compared to the outside.  Food was ready quickly, but the employees, for the most part did not seem to care.    \n\n$0.95 refills on soda.  To the owner, that is unacceptable on a product that is already marked up higher than anything else in most restaurants. Literally the worst Burger King I\'ve ever been to. Lines were long due to the workers taking their time. When they interact with the customers they give attitude. They are VERY disorganized. I waited 40 minutes for my food to come out. I was order number 71 and they were giving out orders in the 90\'s already. Just saying I wouldn\'t come back here. first off I don\'t like BK or fast food joints in general but I needed to use the restroom before getting on PATCO to go back home to Hell (a.k.a. New Jersey) so I sacrificed $1.62 for a small diet coke so I could be buzzed into the restroom , as this BK is right next to the 8th&Market station.. (You can only use the restroom if you buy something and then they will buzz you in..) Considering the exclusivity of the restrooms you would think it might be clean, well guess again, it was pretty nasty. Not incredibly gross and disgusting, but kinda nasty and clearly not cleaned nearly often enough. Dining area also seemed in need of some cleaning, although it was much better than the restroom. The guy at the counter was polite and prompt, as far as my food service experience is concerned it was good, but then again I didn\'t eat any food because BK is just not my thang.. I guess I never have to go back to Burger King again. The crispy chicken was as hard as a rock and impossible to eat.  It was awful! Okay. I did not eat here but I was just using the bathroom. As I walked in, this middle aged (40?) man walked out of the bathroom and was drying his hands in the air. He accidentally hit one of the employees and apologized. This young looking looking latino employee with short hair then responded with a flurry of punches towards this gentleman\'s face, adding provocative comments after the gentleman tried to get out the door. The gentleman was going to call the police but ended up thinking it wasn\'t worth it so I decided to write this report. So, don\'t come here cause there are some short tempered employees here. Would *you* be all cheery to work at Burger King...? Please.  \n\nThe service was fine, the place was very clean, the food was prepared well. Only qualm: the condiments  on my burger weren\'t dispersed as well as I would have liked. "Extra pickles" wasn\'t meant to be five pickles stacked on each other at one end of the burger. Lol. Revising my previous review of this particular Burger King for taking greedy advantage of the Papal Visit by over-doubling it\'s prices (double cheeseburger went from $1.69 to $4 that week), and for not carrying standard promos such as the lack of a Halloween Whopper. This is a much nicer place than it was a year ago, but thats about all I can say about it for now. First time I came here was on 9/28/12. I can\'t remember if I had bought food. This restaurant does get packed since it\'s close to the PATCO 8th and Market station. Service is ok but as mentioned it does get crowded. If you decide to eat in the restaurant, they don\'t have the trays. Currently waiting for my order. Its been more than an hour. Horrendous service. My uber driver has bern waiting for more than a while. Utterly ridiculous I gave you two stars for now because I personally think McDonald\'s is better and you forget my sauces. That is besides the point. I will give you 5 stars if you collab with dairy queen. Let\'s be honest, those mini cinnamon rolls are not good. The benefits of this joint forces idea would be that you get good deserts and it\'s an iconic duo of the king and queen. It would be legendary and you would get an insane amount of customers. I can almost guarantee a rate of success if you do this. All I really want to say is why even have a restaurant if your not even going to challenge yourself and strive for quality. Needless to say, everything that was ordered was down right awful. Never again.... If i could give 0 stars, I would. First, it took 2 hours and 15 minutes for them to even show up, and that was after I called grubhub to see where they were two hours ago. Then, the order was supposed to be a sicillion pizza. This was much more $ than a regular pizza. This was a regular pizza in square shape. The sauce was terrible, the pizza was cold, and it looked thrown together. There was only pepperoni on one side of the pizza. HORRIBLE. Never again. Never. Extremely overpriced. $18 for a large Margherita might have been justified for a great tasting pizza (which I obviously put too much faith in), but it turned out to be lackluster at BEST. \nIt was sopping by the time it arrived which made the cheese slide right off of its extremely thin and moist bread base (meaning the dough was spread way too thin). The cheese also tasted bland, texture was rubbery.\n\nI can\'t speak for any of the other menu items, but if a simple Margherita pizza (tomato sauce, basil (oh yeah, where was the basil?) and mozzarella cheese) was that disappointing, and at such a high of a price point at that, it really does speak volumes.\n\nDelivery (ordered through Grubhub) took nearly 2 hours, and the distance is only 2 miles. I am totally disappointed with this place. I placed an order for the chicken cheesesteak to dine in. The girl at the counter said to have a seat and they\'ll bring out my order. While I waited I saw several people come in, eat and leave, all while I waited for my order! After 26 minutes of waiting I go up to the counter and ask the girl where my food is. I guess it was someone in charge that she asked because she looked at the counter and said my order wasn\'t there. When they started to place my order again, I got pissed off and asked for a refund. They voided the sale and gave me my receipt which I will keep to make sure it was voided. At no point during this encounter did anyone apologize to me. Will never be stepping foot in this place again. I came here several times always takes me to wait. I just order a pick up, I still need to wait after I arrived. From placed order to actual pick up nearly an hour. I don\'t know why. Also they provided bad service and bad attitude. My order is ready by they didn\'t tell me I can pick up. They let me wait half hour. So sad of their service. I would like give them no star!! I work in the area so I make regular stops to Fratelly\'s. Considering I only order two things, I\'d be lying if I said all the food was great, but I will say their chicken Caesar salad & chicken cheesesteak are delicious. They prepare food in a timely manner and the two girls that typically work the front of very friendly and well manner. Two thumbs up. Sorry I could not give them no stars. It took them almost two hours to deliver our cold pizza, cold fries and a warm milkshake.  I was so upset I couldn\'t even eat.  \nHappy Mothers Day to me. Never, never again.  \nDo not, I repeat do not order from this awful place. Wanted a relaxing dinner with no cooking for me, since it is Mothers Day and I really didn\'t want to cook.\nThanks so much Fratelly. You RUINED my day. I love this place the food was delicious i ordered the homemade chicken tenders they were amazing and I also ordered the chicken Alfredo and broccoli pizza this was my first time ordering from here saw it on grub hub and said i would give it a try and i was not disappointed.the customer service was good.thank you keep doing what you do. I don\'t know why the average rating is only two stars because I had a good experience with Fratelly.\n\nI ordered through grub hub.\nFirst someone called to confirm my order which i really liked. \n\nI ordered the upside down pizza, wings, cheese waffle fries.\n\nThe pizza was good I liked it. My boyfriend normally doesn\'t like plain pizza but he liked it too, which is saying a lot. Perfect amount of cheese and sauce. The crust was good too. It was garlic-y which I liked.\n\nThe wings I ordered half dry and half with mild sauce. Also very good.\n\nThe cheese waffle fries had a lot of cheese and was very good too. \n\nThey remembered my drink!! Which a lot of places forget.\n\nDelivery was prompt, on time and friendly.\nOverall I had a good experience I really like how they confirmed my grub hub order too. I will definitely order from here again! All I can say is hmm hmm good, I ordered whole roasted chicken , pork ribs , veggie, fries, and garlic bread and everything was excellent except whole chicken wasn\'t big size portions like Boston Market Chicken, so I took away 1 star for that and they were a little late delivering food but other than that food tasted great Ordered their food and grub hub and it was a gamble to begin with. It turned out to be a losing gamble. Fratelly\'s cooked the wrong order then when I called back to let them know the girl on the phone says "well its the same price as the food you ordered so...........". How does that make it better? Its my money and that\'s not what I wanted or ordered. Fratellys has no customer service and a cook that possibly cant read orders either. smh. You wont get another dollar from me. Stay away!!! Ordered dinner for my family at 7pm on a tuesday. 1 hour later no food so i gave them a call. i was told food is out and should be there any moment. 9pm still no food so i call again and tell them to keep it. No apology no explanation. Two days later i notice my card was still charged for the order. Call again guy who claims to be manager says he\'ll take care of it. Still no apology! Waited until monday charge still there so I go to the shop after work. The same guy I talked to on the phone tells me he cant do anything until the owner arrives. I lose my sh## at this point. This douche tells me I should be more understanding because they were very busy that night. Still no apology! I think everyone could see this was going too get ugly really fast so he gave me my refund in cash. Never again I remember when this place used to be Gino\'s Pizza....and the food tastes exactly the same. Over the course of the past 15 years, this location has been home to many different pizza places....and apparently none of them thought to change the layout of the dine in section....and no one changed the décor either....it has that overly Italian feel to it....where everything is Italian....the pictures on the wall and the tiling on the floors....the tiny little booths spread far apart and the layout of the counter....funny thing is, this place isn\'t owned by any Italians...and I doubt their name is Fratelli...one dude is Mexican and the other is either Armenian or Greek....so obviously their Italian food falls short.\n\nThey do sell pizza by the slice, which is great if you are looking for a quick lunch stop, and they have drinks and stuff so yay....the pizza crust is floppy, which I happen to like sometimes....but damn that pizza is extra greasy...like I literally hold the pizza by its crust and just let the grease drip off....ughhhhh.\n\nthe cheese fries are great....except they like glop the whiz right in the middle so all these fries are all naked and cheeseless and the fries in the middle are like drowning in it.....sad fries.\n\nIts not the cleanest of places....and lord....for all of love in the world, don\'t go into their bathroom....some kind of disease will follow you out....if you have to pee, go to the DD down the street. Poor service, the wings were hard as shit! We called and complained they offered  10 percent off the next purchase. We explained we would NOT like to order from here again. No return call from the manger/owner whomever. Mind you my order came up to $42,and the driver had the nerve to stand and pretty much wait for an addition tip. Never again Worst Pizzaria in the área. I just ordered a pizza 7:42pm. Have been waiting for it. for  over two hours. Keep calling them and they tell is on its way. Not realiable and completely irresponsible. Their food is very good You have a wide selection to choose from restaurant s  is air conditioned and clean Huge chunks of pepper on pizza (the ones they put on salads) and super thin pieces of what they call sausage. Pizza slices are also very thin, but the crust is huge and doughy. Chicken fingers are huge but overcooked and tasteless. No honey mustard sent with it. The only thing good in this order was the fries. Ugh never ever ordering from there again! Don\'t eat here! We used to all the time and one morning walking the mall we saw all the pizza still out from the night before. It was not opened yet lights were off no one in there. I went in Macy\'s cam out shortly after and watched as they opened we wanted a soda. As we left and were walking by the glass I saw the girl serve some young guy the night before pizza. It was not even covered just sitting under the glass. They threw it in the over for him and I went in to let him know. I called bbb on them and they told me to take it up with the store. The staff did not care so we don\'t eat there. I wish I had been smart enough to video it because I would have blasted them on the news. This place is horrible. I ordered through EAT24 and ordered a stromboli. Waited an hour and they delivered a pizza instead. I called to get the correct order and was told they would send it out and it was my fault cause it came over not saying stromboli.  It clearly did not say pizza and the stromboli description that went to them on my order matched their printed menu. They were clearly wrong. Waited another hour and 20 minutes and still no stromboli. Called yet again and spoke to the manager who gave me the worst service stating it was not their fault and he will now send a stromboli. Still waiting. He told me to order over the phone next time. Funny! NEVER AGAIN will I order from here! STAY AWAY! Prices are cheap, food was okay.. But walked in for a quick bite, ordered a chicken gyro.. After waiting for 20 minutes I asked for a refund so I could leave, the cashier said no, and gave a few excuses.. Gyro was ready after 25 minutes.. Give me a break. ive tried going here four times with no success because the drive tru takes so long that i have pulled away every single time. great job idiots! You get to wait 20 minutes even when first in line at the drive thru window. Now worth it - even of their fries are die-worthy! This is one of the worst McDonalds on ever been to it\'s so dirty the food is horrible customer service is the pits it is one of the worst worst McDonald\'s ever been into very unsanitary don\'t eat here I will try to keep this one as gentle as possible.\n\nThis place sucks.\n\nThis location is probably the most inconsistent one out there. Nothing is ever made on a good standard level that I know McDonald\'s can deliver. \n\nSometimes you get a sweet tea, it\'s great. Sometimes, it\'s bland. Sometimes, it\'s like drinking sugar. This goes for everything else on the menu. It\'s like gambling to go here.\n\nAlso, they do not like to give you your change (1 - 4 cents) back. I thought it was standard? I only had this problem on drive-thru though.\n\nIt is not "24/7 drive-thru" either. I went by around 4 in the morning, and was told they were closed. I guess they make their own rules! Oh, I love the Girard and Broad intersection. Flies all over and even though it wasn\'t crowded it took 10 minutes for someone to come to the register to help me and waited an additional  30+ minutes for my food and all I ordered was a sausage mcmuffin meal. And after all that I had to get out of my car and go back in because they forgot the hashbrown. This is the worst McDonald\'s on the face of the earth. Period. I strongly wish they get their franchise pulled it\'s an absolute joke. Expect to wait 20 minutes at least. Expect a very rude, not trained staff, THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. Has your staff ever been to a McDonald\'s before? I am a huge advocate for McDonald\'s and visit frequently but this one is so absolutely pitiful it makes me want to go across the street to checkers(eww). Definitely the worst McDonald\'s I\'ve been yet.\n\nGrowing up, I loved McDonald\'s even McDonald\'s himself had always looked creepy to me. (I\'ve always been a fan of the Hamburglar but never mind that) I adored their food and remember how big and plump the Big Mac seemed and not this mushed together thing that we\'ve come to known. Up until recently that I realized how bad fast food actually is and I\'ve swore off it for years. That is until now that my job has brought me to an area of culinary desert, we got nothing but fast food, fried chicken and a deli around the 4 blocks area. It\'s a dead zone.\n\nSo I\'ve retreated to fast food, a man\'s got to eat. Especially when the man is forgetful when he gets home and too lazy sometimes to plan his own lunch ahead.\n\nI\'ve been to this McDonald\'s 3 times for breakfast and lunch alike. While in surface, everything taste the same. This McDonald\'s is the most ghettlest of them all. Their cashiers have the nastiest attitude even I try to use thank you and please to force some customer service out of them.\n\nThe juice is half filled. When there is no ice in the ice machine, they just stand there and say they will refill it soon but they don\'t. They give you one napkin for your whole meal and there\'s no additional napkins to be found. They don\'t give you any ketchup or peanut or spoons for your sundae. They give you 1/3 of the normal amount of chocolate sauce for your sundae. Just a little on top like a suggestion that it is a chocolate sundae. The ice cream is also half-full (half-empty if you\'re a pessimist) and half-melted (half-solid if you\'re an optimist). It\'s not like I know them so I wonder why they act like I\'m the asshole who\'s bothering them by making them go get my food. No smile and full of \'tude. Is there no quality control?\n\nWell, it\'ll just make me want to bring my lunch more and hopefully keep me from being supersized Worst McDonald\'s ever. So dirty and the customer service is like shit. Don\'t go!! Flies all over the place and the foods are bad This McDonald\'s is a literal nightmare. I\'ve witnessed drive thru window fights. Literally, two people inside the window fighting the employees as they agitated. No one does anything here besides stand around. I got bitched at one day because some girl working the window handed me my drink and said have a good night and slammed it shut. Well, I ordered a meal, not a drink. When I beeped to clarify if she got my food order I was treated like some kind of imbecile because she could see my order "on the screen in here!" She "can\'t miss it!!"\n\nAvoid at all costs. If this was the only McDonald\'s left on this great planet, I\'d still eat white dog shit before dealing with these Neanderthals. Reviewing a McDonald\'s....yes, it\'s silly, but the public needs to be warned to never visit this one.\n\n2 stars: I can\'t knock this place for being unhealthy. When you intentionally visit a McDonald\'s establishment, you go knowing full well the consequences. So 2 stars for the food and impending heartburn. \n\n3 stars: The French Fries. Not going to lie. I would eat them right now if presented with those delicious golden bitches.\n\n0 Stars: The unbelievably terrible service. Now I know I\'m not going to receive a 5-star experience, but come on. One time my bf ordered a double cheeseburger and received it sans burger patties (only buns, lettuce, onions, ketchup), another time we ordered TWO STRAWBERRY milkshakes and received THREE VANILLA milkshakes. How is that even possible? 0 stars for incompetency. Don\'t even THINK about specializing your order.\n\nSomehow it also takes them forever and a half to get your order to you. So not only is it incorrect, but it is also delivered to your car just seconds before you decide to eat your shoes.\n\n0 stars: For only having meals after 10 o\'clock.\n\nGrand Total of 1 star...and that\'s a generous gift. Wish I could give ZERO stars. I was there 2/2/19 around 10:30 pm. It was not busy at all. Service was slow and the customer service was atrocious. To top it alll off I got a cheeseburger.. simplest thing, and they decided to add a ton of mayo.. why?? I didn\'t ask for that? So I turn around drive back and they are rude to me when I ask for a new one. I am like beside myself.  I love McDonald\'s and this location has just did me so poorly that I will never be going back. Learn how to hire better staff McDonald\'s. Smh. Sat in the drive through for 35 minutes waiting for my food, the order came out in correct, and waited an additional 25 minutes for the correct order. Not to mention the inside was completely empty.... not even a crazy busy night. Beyond frustrated Since I have to rate it one star for the win...... first off, I contacted McDonald\'s and haven\'t heard back at all. This particular store has no identifying manager so I\'ll say it\'s self run by the employees and it needs a manager badly, the staff is rude, the food gave me a stomach bug for dayssss and I mean days!, hygiene needs to be a serious priority at this establishment. Worst place. No one cares or wants to help. Rude \nWonder why??? Came for Temple game. No Temple students should ever go here 1 patty on a double cheeseburger...a susage mcmuffin instead of a sausage egg and cheese on a buiscuit...and oreo frappe instead of chocolate chip..no apple pie. This was all 1 order. Luckily it was postmates so i got it all free..but come on guys, get it together. It\'s not a hard job. This is not only the worst McDonald\'s I\'ve ever been to but the most repulsive joke of a food establishment I\'ve ever seen. The staff is rude and the food takes forever. When I got my food I was given ONE sauce so I asked for another and two of the staff looked at me, nodded there heads and looked away and completely ignored me. There were no napkins, no straws, no tea, no lids, the entire building was filthy and disgusting. It looked like It hadn\'t been cleaned in months. I wouldn\'t recommend this place to anyone. If you\'re on your way there please for your own sake turn the hell around. Wow, I wish I didn\'t turned in here to pick up food. Sitting in the drive thru for 20 minutes just waiting for my order but too scared to honk cuz I don\'t want my food to be spat on. Worst McDonald\'s ever!! They take forever and are rude. I never write reviews so you know a sis really not about it! They all need a whole new staff training because they suck Shoutout to these people who want $14 an hour but can\'t put any sauce in my 20 piece nuggets! Even though we asked to make sure they were in it. They aren\'t. Sad. Bring a chair cos you\'ll be waiting for 15 min or more to get your food. Breakfast sandwich, good luck. Might as well go to Dunkin donuts up the street or just wait for a while. They aren\'t following covid guidelines and safety precautions. Barely anyone was wearing a mask. Rude staff who refused to be helpful. I asked for a refund because the young lady handling my order had her mask around her chin the entire time and wasn\'t wearing gloves when touching my food. No gloves and no hand washing touching fries as she put them in the bag. The cashier was also not wearing a mask. This place is the worst McDonalds in the world. I know that sounds hard but this place is run by total morons, it is disgustingly dirty, the wait times are atrocious and the food (which should be exactly the same as any other McDonalds) is untasty and tossed in the bag like it was made by mentally deranged criminals. Stopped in this place for a Happy Meal on 05/16/2019. \n\nI can\'t believe this is an actual McDonald\'s! At first I thought that it must be a knock off one like the one in that movie, "Coming to America" w Eddie Murphy from way back. "McDowell\'s" or something like that it was called in the movie. At least the one in the movie was clean. This one, it\'s absolutely the worst one that I\'ve ever been in or even heard about!! Exceptionally dirty! Were those bug zappers on the walls? It\'s attached to a filthy,  blown out BP gas station. I. Just. Couldn\'t. Believe. This. Place. \n\nMcDonald\'s Corporate, what do they have on y\'all that you can\'t shut these guys down? Seriously, it truly shocks me that the City Health Department hasn\'t closed this place down. During the 20 minutes that we waited for our food we looked and looked for a Food Safety Rating but couldn\'t find one. \n\nStay. The. Heck. Away. In the words of my 16 year old daughter..."ew".  To call it gross would be offense to grossness.  The employees stare at you like they\'re ready to fight.  Apparently they\'re paid by the number of words spoken as they do more stating than interacting.  The food was fine which is factored into the rating of 1.  Here\'s the worst part.  I foolishly decided to use the restroom.  Apparently something died in there...2 years ago...is still decomposing...creating smells I didn\'t know were possible.  Apparently 9 of 10 patrons (or as I suspect employees) miss the toilet.  The bathroom door doesn\'t lock.  There are no paper towels or functional dryer.  The soap dispenser was apparently torn down in the late 70\'s.   Ew. Since I have to rate it one star for the win...... first off, I contacted McDonald\'s about this place and haven\'t heard back at all. This particular store has no identifying manager so I\'ll say it\'s self run by the employees and it needs a manager badly, the staff is rude, the food gave me a trouble stomach bug for dayssss and I mean days!, hygiene needs to be a serious priority at this establishment as well as customer service , safety sanitation, work ethic. This has to be the worst McDonald\'s ever. The people who work here don\'t ven know what they are doing and they look at you like you came from another world. I have nothing against new people in training but if you are in busy hours just have people that are already trained at the counter. I waited 50 minutes for two hamburgers. Incredible. Not coming back to this location. If you know what is good for you, you will avoid this place like the plague. A late night craving for junk food brought me to the drive through where I found a long backed up line of cars that wasn\'t moving because staff inside decided that they didn\'t feel like taking orders. They made excuses like "we\'re doing a shift change" and that the "headset was broken" (then how are you communicating with me through the speaker?). After at least 15 minutes the relented and finally took the order. While waiting for the order we watched the person working in the drive through window open the window and scream at a person passing by "I\'m going to f*****g kill you!" which left us absolutely stunned. We waited nearly 20 more minutes for the food, and when the order finally came out it was, of course, wrong. The employees only yelled at us and refused to fix it, so we just left and complained to McDonalds. The manager\'s mediocre response was, "I\'m sorry you feel we have let you down." McDonalds corporate should shut this place down. This McDonald\'s is the worst restaurant on earth. I\'ve never seen such disrespect , ignorant , non courteous people. Did I mention it\'s a haven for drug dealers and addicts alike . Even the employees are copping drugs . The neighborhood could be better if this place closed. DONT NOT PAY WITH DEBT/CREDIT CARD !!! \n\nThis location has someone who hacks debt/credit cards and then will go next door to the gas station and charge it to your card. I thought I got the situation taken care of the first time they charged $75 to my account but the bastard still has my account number and is now making more charges. I will find you ya scum ! Stopped her on my lunch break to grab something quick it.wasnt quick the drive thru was so slow and I waited 10 to 15 minutes to get my food . I ordered a minute maid slushy it wasnt even filled up the fries were cold and the chicken nuggets were dried out and rubbery tasting.  I do not recommend stopping at this locations food was horrible and the wait was too long Worst McDonald\'s experience I\'ve ever had. I had ordered a chicken sandwich but got a burger instead. I was in a rush so I just accepted the mistake but half way through I noticed there was mold on the bun!  Also ordered 10 nuggets but only received 7! These idiots can\'t even count. The staff are UNBELIEVABLY RUDE and slow, even by McDonald\'s in North Philly standards. Going to cut this review short because I\'m pretty sure I have to go vomit now. Literally the worst location I\'ve ever been to.  The place literally smells like ass and is ALWAYS dirty.  The population surrounding it is poor so they never have any of the "fancier" items like lattes, smoothies, etc even though they have it on their menus and have the machines to make them.   It\'s really just burgers, fries and soda here.  I ordered a coffee here and they the woman gave me a sandwich bag with sugar and cream as they don\'t even have the modern machines where you push the buttons to add the condiments.  Those things were put into McD\'s over a decade ago.  Never go here. Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI will never come here ever again. The service wasn\'t bad the the food was made sloppy. My sisters cheeseburger had hard bread on top and it was ripped on the side so they had to remake it. After drinking 3/4 of my drink I noticed mold on the side of my cup. I ended up paying $24 for a breakfast sandwich. When i called the store the man who picked up said " hey nigger why don\'t you cry to your momma, this is MCDONALDS." Really? I mean i guess thats it then.\n\n*disclaimer: paid in cash Just waited in the drive through line for 25 minutes...FOR TWO ICE CREAMS! So slow and rude. Ever since the Philly Police installed a mini-station next to the serving counter, this McDonalds really cleaned up its act.  Sure, the dining room and parking swarm with those huddled masses that didn\'t so much fall as joyously leapt off the wagon a long time past and retain little intention of climbing back aboard.  So, you\'re still in fine company.  In a corner booth sits Schizo engaged in lively conversation with his empty coffe cup.  In a middle booth you\'ll find Shakey aiming that McDouble for her mouth but hitting her cbheek.  Along side her, witness her buddy, Sleepy, nodding off and sweating, the poor fellow! \n\nBut, the old gang aside, in comes the law and out goes the riff-raff.  You won\'t be hassled for change while you eat, and the cleanliness no longer approximates an old movie house.  Your feet no longer stick to the floor after you sit up from a booth.  Each booth contains at least two fully sit-able seats.  Granted, the food still retains its urban McDonalds "flavor" and the atmosphere may be characterized as "questionable".\n\nHowever, the Broad & Girard McDonalds witnessed a stunning historic event its suburban counterparts surely and jealously long for.  In 1999, the Ol\' Dirty Bastard, ever the rascal, escaped from court-ordered drug rehabilitation and fled as a fugitive from the law.  An always vigilant Philly police officer recognized him, ran the license of his Jersey car idling at the drive-through window, and the rest is, as they say, history.  Let\'s have a mural! The worst McDonalds I have ever been to. They didnt even take my order at the screen, they took it at the window and had me sit there for 5 minutes before telling me. I waited over 25 minutes for my food and watched all the workers stand around not working.... The person behind me got their food before i did. Never go here, i will never be returning. Went here for a late night meal. I kid you not, when I got home with the food a cockroach crawled out of my burger. So needless to say this place is dirty, the people aren\'t friendly. There\'s always some sketchy things happening outside of the building too. Don\'t go here. No surprise hands down the slowest most pathetic place on the face of the planet... the morons at work here are lucky if they can count their fingers and toes. Slower than molasses in winter time I really can\'t think of anything else to comprehend the total inability to have the ability to work. They want $15 an hour you must be joking me ,  I wouldn\'t pay them $2 for the speed that they\'re working at. Other than that were in dire need of subsidence this place is a pathetic joke the manager should be fired the employees should be strung up and smacked with a wet whip... absolutely no care in the world for anybody other than themselves why do they work here get a job at Walmart you could probably get by better but don\'t leave us out here hanging hungry in the middle of the night I can cook a burger faster on my car hood... obviously extremely distraught this place is going to end me. I can\'t give a lower rating, asked for very simple by the menu orders, two burgers in the two for five deal and one value meal burger and the two for five burgers were both not only wrong (different burgers) but the buns were stale and each one only had some of the toppings and one was missing a meat patty ( supposed to be a double). The value meal burger was supposed to be a double with bacon and BBQ sauce. Was given a single plain cheeseburger. They got the drinks right and the fries were the wrong size so basically we were overcharged for everything. There was no line and no one behind us so they weren\'t even busy. Avoid this location. I love checkers food and was so excited to get a late night meal. We ordered a cheeseburger and two spicy chicken sandwiches. What did we get? Two burgers and a regular chicken sandwich. While in line I also want to add someone ran up to the drive through window and was begging for more honey mustard. It was a bizarre place-go here if you want a good laugh When I want a good  burger at a good price either it\'s beef or chicken I come here not McDonald\'s or buyer king! Don\'t waste your time or money here.  Shitty fast food for long waits, absolutely unacceptable. It\'s a dirty burger joint in North Philly. If you\'re hungry and need something fast, its ok. The fries are great, but the burgers don\'t nearly compare to Five Guys or Bobby\'s Burger Place. If I could give a 0 I would. My strongest and best advice for anyone is to avoid this place at all cost, ESPECIALLY at night.\n\nNot only are the employees incompetent, they are rude and are far from clean while handling food. Never once have I ever seen anyone wearing gloves, even after handling money. \n\nI can\'t count the number of times that I\'ve stupidly went to this Checkers because they were the only late night option. To give you a sense of just how bad this place is, I\'ll break it down simply:\n\n1. Walk in and stand in a line while trying to avoid the trash that litters the floor. Hopefully your cellphone battery is almost full because you\'ll need a distraction while waiting for the abysmally slow cashier to finally come to the window and greet someone, let alone acknowledge them.\n\n2. When its finally your turn to order, stand and continuously try to make eye contact with any of the employees joking and playing around and hope that they finally come over to take your order. 90% of the time they do not. Once they actually decided to let the line move  and come to the window, be sure to get your order out as quickly as possible before they slam the window shut to continue laughing with their coworkers.\n\n3. Great. You\'ve finally managed to place your order and it only took you about 20 minutes. All you have to do now is wait for your food -- when they actually start to sloppily make it. Be sure to stand near the pick up window because they have a habit of just opening it and standing there with the bag in their hand and expecting you to read their minds on which food belongs to you. \nStill with me? Okay, so now you have your food. Make sure to check the contents and see if there are any mistakes. There\'s a good chance something is wrong. \n\nThis is not an isolated incident. As I said earlier, I can\'t count the number of times this has happened. It\'s almost routine. Even when the store is empty they will make you wait. I once showed up an hour before closing and standing there for nearly 30 minutes (was very tipsy and needed food) watching them in the back as they watched me and kept on with their conversation. When she finally decided to come over, she informed me they were closed. I pointed out the time and she just stared blankly, although I can\'t say that I was surprised by this. When I demanded to know why they didn\'t come up sooner and tell me they were closed, she lies and said she didn\'t see me. Right. \n\nThis place is by far the worst Checkers (or fast food restaurant) that I\'ve ever been to. \nAVOID AT ALL COSTS! If I could give this checkers zero stars I would. I know when I went it was Late but it claims it is open till 6am. I even called before I went to see if they were open...I drove here only for the employee to tell me his computer was down..and they were not serving... Complete waste of my time... The only reason to eat here is theyre 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays so chances are your tummy is grumbling and youre pretty desperate. \nThis is the worst customer service chain , it is almost constant at every branch, somehow they have thrived in Philly. \nThe Buford and the Chicken strips are good and the milkshakes but expect to wait 20 minutes for it. If youre scrimping on gas do not wait via drive thru but if you value your life since the shady people waiting at the take out booth by all means burn that fuel. \nI wish Sonic Drive thru would someday could rescue this city from Checkers. NEVER go here. Went here with my friend; they got the order wrong and charged us a lot ($17 for shitty fast food). tried to get refund because we didn\'t order 17$ worth of their shitty fast food-- long story short the manager started screaming ghetto at us saying "we don\'t do refunds," threw fries at us, and hit my friend through the window (you can\'t talk to them unless they open the window).  \n\nGet your money back by calling checkers headquarters in FL (813) 283-7000 they are much more professional, thank god.   Enter at your own risk..... I\'ve tried this restaurant on a Sunday night and my complexed orders was made right and fast. He added other promos that really help me saved money.  I don\'t know who the guy was at the drive thru but he a good customer service. This is a good place for late night food. The only reason I didn\'t given them 5 stars was that their are hoodlums soliciting around the restaurants and the homeless coming up to people\'s car windows for money while I\'m at the drive thru. That environment makes me feel a little unsafe. The atmosphere of this place is truly relaxing. The staff are more than helpful and super friendly. They went above and beyond and I could taste the love that they inserted into my burger. The decor is feng shui and I really felt at home in this lovely establishment! Viola¡ This place is a hazard. Tire popped on the way out with dangerous lack of signs and razor sharp concrete everywhere, they spit in my food and the manager literally ignored me when I brought it up to them. You can see the massive number of cars that have been broken on their dangerous curbs. This place is 15 osha violations and I am reporting them. Checkers Rally\'s recently released strawberry soft serve ice cream. The sign showed a bright pink ice cream on a cone, and I knew I had to try it (even though it\'s freezing cold )! Although I tried it for the color, the taste was somewhat nostalgic and reminded me of the pink strawberry shortcake ice cream bars I used to eat as a kid. Overall, not the best, but it was fun to try! Also, if you haven\'t had them yet, the fries here are amazing!\n\nLocation review: The employees were very friendly and kind.  The glass walls made it difficult for them to hear my order, so unfortunately I had to repeat myself a few times. This location has a small interior with little room. However, there is a drive thru for to go orders, and there are benches outside if someone wishes to sit there and eat. The outside area didn\'t look too clean though, so this place is probably better if you\'re looking for fast food to go! Checkers is the high point of culinary experimentation in North Philadelphia. These renegade chefs are whipping up a plethora of boldly flavored dishes and appetizers. It is difficult to imagine how someone could possibly pack so much perfectly viscous (and delicious) grease into toasted mess piles of bacon, toast and "burger." You may be tempted to go to the McDonalds across the street, and you also may be the dumbest person alive. These burgers are the bomb dot com. You like milkshakes? These milkshakes are the bomb dot com. You like weird semi-outdoor ordering areas? This semi-outdoor ordering area is the bomb dot com. Additionally, you will almost definitely be offered Oxycontin on market pricing. I don\'t know any foodie that doesn\'t like to "get his downer on" before feasting on the finest marbleized Kobe beef in this area. This beef is the bomb dot com. \n\nMy only real problem with this location is the patio-style terrace seating outside of the weird, semi-outdoor ordering area. I can deal with the slightly-slower-than-average service, but this tiny seating area is really unacceptable. I had to listen to so many cars during my meal. Sure, the restaurant is located on the busiest street in Philadelphia, but I expect better soundproofing from a restaurateur like Mr. Checkers. Maybe they could put up a large bush or something? I\'m not a sound-proofing expert, so I will not step outside of my bounds here. \n\nIn short, come for the best cuts of beef in the northeast and stay for the drugs. comical how horrendous this place is, in terms of customer service and quality of food. i used to live down the street, and because of their hours i wound going many times despite previous nightmarish experiences. no matter if i ordered 2$ worth of food or 20, the wait was ALWAYS 25 mins or more. mind you, with maybe one or two other customers. i have personally witnessed employees drop meat on the floor and put it right back on the bun. this place is so bad i remember there was an incident in the paper where one of the employees actually came out and shot someone they were arguing with(not sure if it was a customer or not) disgusting subhuman employees, decent food if handled propertly, and the absolutely worst customer service in the world. I have no other Checkers to compare this location to because it\'s the only one I\'ve been to. \nThat being said this location is awful. My friends and I decided to stop walking to campus by after a long day in center city. We all ordered different meals and were intrigued by the low prices and frozen drinks. I didn\'t expect all of us to end up on the toilet not even two hours later. It was an awful experience and the low prices were surely not worth it. On three separate occasions at this exact location my debit card was over charge they swiped my card for my actual order then a second time for god knows what use cash only at this location and check your bank statements someone is stealing they charge my card $15.54 for a two for three meal If you\'re into self depreciation and regret come to Checkers!\n\nOrder yourself a cheeseburger, extra greasy fries and a coke. \n\nBut remember, the feeling is only temporary. This is one of the worst drive-ins I\'ve ever been to, hands down. It should be called Hotel Checkers. Because once you are in line, you\'ll never leave. At least almost never. The previous reviewer was not kidding about the 20 minutes part. I\'ve gone through complete sports radio cycles/news radio cycles and back into the rehash before even getting up to the drive in window. \n\nMe: I\'d like the Mongo Burger with fries\nlong pause\nThem: What do you want(Their voice laden with static)\nMe: (yelling because I"m not sure they can hear me over the tin can speakers) I\'d like the Mongo burger with fries\nThem: Would you like anything else?\nMe: No\nThem: Pull around\n\nAt this point time slows down into 9th St Post office/glacialness. The cars in front seem to stand still. Meanwhile the assorted and random characters drift across the parking lot. Multiple Philly cops go screaming up and down Broad Street and Girard. You start to think, crap, maybe this wasn\'t such a good idea. By this time, someone\'s behind you so you figure ok, I\'ll stick to it. After several commercials and various comments on how the Phillies aren\'t getting it done and people hoping the Eagles will go to the Super Bowl, you finally pull up to the window. \n\nHere\'s where the Checker\'s differs from the other drive-ins. First of all you have people randomly walking up to you asking you for money. And then there is the occasional guy that just stands there looking at you. And no one from the Checker\'s store goes out and shoo\'s these guys away. \n\nThen there is the joy of dealing with the register person. My last and final trip to this establishment, I had the "I"m too busy talking on the phone to my friends to give you good service" person. She took at least 3 minutes to even acknowledge that I\'d pulled up. Then she opened up the window, took my money and started cursing on the phone. This wasn\'t a simple s or f-word. This was a swear laden rant that would have impressed a sailor. Now I"m not saying I don\'t swear. But when I have to deal with the public, I refrain from it unless someone drops a 10 ton desk on my foot or I nearly get run over. Evidently this person hadn\'t gotten the corporate memo on "Appropriate behavior during your drive thru cashier shift".  She finally disengages herself from the phone long enough to give me my change. Then I wait another 5 minutes for my food. This time I had some joker come up to me and ask for change for a dollar. Last time I checked, that\'s what a cashier was for dude. \n\nFinally I get my food. No apology for how slow it was, no thank you. She just returned to swearing at whomever it was on the other end of her phone. I leave with my gas tank almost empty, I\'m hot, pissed off, and amazed at how crappy service can be. \n\nI\'d rather poke my eyes out with a sharp stick than go here again. Staff is hella rude. Inside looks way too dirty for a restaurant and again, the staff is HELLA RUDE. Food was ok, but overall place is terrible. Was in a MOOD for some Checkers fries and I was in the area visiting a friend. Fries were highly disappointing. I should have went to the location on Broad and Champlost cuz the fries are always hot & fresh there (at least for me). Ordered #2. Great first time. Good attitude for fast food joint and good wait time. I know I am crazy for expecting good service from a fast food place in the city but it really should not be so impossible to find. I went inside the checkers and they did not have signage for their two for three deals so I asked the cashier and she was unable to put together whole sentences and communicate the menu to me in a professional manner without getting extremely ignorant and ghetto because I did not understand. I am sure people wonder why that location does so poorly and that is why. They were completely empty with no customers which is why I went there in the first place because the McDonald\'s right next door was bumping. I went back to McDonald\'s and received great service even though they are very busy. I hope management sees this and fixes their problems Checkers. They are few and far in-between. I honestly have never heard of them before I traveled the roads of Philly, however when I finally gave them a shot, I was not disappointed. \n\nI had no idea what to expect when I ordered their burgers and fries. I have to say other fast foods like wendys and mcdonalds have much better marketing and distribution, but in Philly you can\'t go a few miles without seeing a checkers which says something. First off the food was comparable to wendys or other places, and I think the fries are better then mcdonalds and bk. \n\nCheckers seems to have done something interesting though, they have double sided drive throughs. Yes a drive thru on each side. So if you have a passenger it works best (otherwise you\'ll be crawling out your passenger side door and that\'s just silly). \n\nIf you happen to cross paths with a checkers I would recommend it, just ask them to NOT put mayo on it because they tend to go overboard with it...unless that\'s your thing Dried up fish. Food tasted disgusting. Took one bite and threw it away. Checkers is usually good. Looks like they reheated this after it has been sitting out for three hours. I love Checkers just as much as the next person, their food is to die for but the service at this location is HORRIBLE. They have 2 drive thru windows and I don\'t even know for what because we waited for over 10 minutes just to order! Another 10+ minutes to get our food! Not to mention half of the stuff we wanted wasn\'t available- no milkshakes, no wings, no coca cola, no sprite- the list goes on. This location needs to retrain their staff on what FAST food is- I could sit down at a restaraunt and order and receive my food faster then I did at this location. Unbelievable. Ugh i really like Checkers but this one always serves stone cold burgers. Periodically i stop in to see if this has changed. This has been ongoing for years. My first time in about 6 months.. I decided to go and give them another shot. Stone cold burger again. This happens here about 80% of the time. I think this is the reason why its almost always empty. So if you like your burgers nice and icy stop on in. On 03/25/16 my friend and I went to Checkers drive thru. I told my friend I\'ll get whatever he\'s getting. So he ordered checkerburgers with nothing but onions and mustard. He said it multiple times that that\'s all he wanted on the burgers. After waiting 20 mins because the people ahead of us held up the line we finally get to the window and they hand us our food. We check a couple burgers and there\'s ketchup, pickles, and mustard and no onions. My friend told the clerk that\'s not what he wanted he said he just wanted onions and mustard. The girl that was in the kitchen said in a rude manner "we have no onions." She got mad at us like it was our fault. My friend said you should have told me you didn\'t have any instead of going through with the order and charging me. He said let me speak to your manager. So the manager comes over. My friend said I want a refund and I\'m taking the burgers. The manager said no if I refund you you give me the burgers back because that\'s inventory. After a couple minutes of back and forth my friend said give me your corporate number. They did and my friend asked for his name. The manager\'s name is Anthony. He wasn\'t even in proper uniform he was wearing a polo shirt. After that experience I will not be back to this Checker\'s. I\'ve been to this place twice. the first time they didn\'t open until 12:00pm and the second time, they didn\'t open until 1:00. not sure if they are making their own rules and open up whenever they want. Online saids it open at 10:00am. Wish I could give NO stars to this location!\n\nI\'ve never had a cold burger from a fast food restaurant until today. Ordered the cheesy combo sandwich. I love fast food, but this location and experience killed that streak. \n\nThe price of the sandwich, according to the drive-thru menu, was $3.99, but when I paid, I got charged $4.49. The employee did not care to correct the mistake when I brought it up, and said that the drive-thru menu is incorrect. He then shut the sliding window in my face. So rude! \n\nNever ever going back to this location again. Will go to the McDonald\'s next door! As i stated in another review i stop in here once or twice a year. Nothing has changed here. I use to live in the area and still have friends and family that live here.They always serve COLD FOOD..I came in 3/28/16 burger was cold french fries cold and ordered chili fries for someone else. COLD COLD and dry.. This is the same way this place has been for years. Out of 10 times that you go maybe 2 of them they will serve you warm food. Go to another checkers..The only difference this time they were a bit quicker than most of the other times i have stopped in here.Other Checkers ive been to arent like this..Its just this one for some reason.. Literally spit the burger out!   \n\nThe good:  Milkshake was solid - not exceptional, but certainly acceptable.  \n\nThe bad:  fried Oreos were a mixed bag. The first two were pretty good - but the remainder were hard and I gave up.  \n\nThe ugly:   WORST.  BURGER.  EVER.  So, the bun and toppings seemed like they would be ok - even good - if not for being paired with the most tasteless piece of meat ever. It\'s a shame a place calling itself "Burger Lane" falls short on the burger.  Frankly it ruined the whole thing.  \n\nI don\'t see this place having much business if they don\'t improve quality. Food just arrived, entire meal was inedible. I never write reviews but felt it was necessary to write this one. Not good food. The name mean more to the hood then the food.  Thanks for being black owned.  That\'s it I supported their store and didn\'t like my 40.00 purchase. I like it! I use Uber Eats to be served!!! I want to try the wings and fried shrimp next!! Not impressed I hated the Rockadelphia sandwich had a weird taste to it they must make it better for Pnb Rock.\nFried pickles suck and the burger lane burger was bad. The only ok thing was the chicken and waffle sandwich. I will not be returning ever. Burger came cold and the patties were burnt to a crisp. They provided no ketchup for an order that included a double burger, fries and onion rings. Also had chicken fingers in the order that were supposed to come with ranch dressing, and there was no dressing\n\nI called up and they said they ran out of ketchup. If you run a burger joint, HOW ON EARTH do you manage to run out of KETCHUP?!?!\n\nAll manager said was sorry for inconvenience. No attempt to make up the subpar service up to me. Never ordering again. I\'ve been ordering from this place for at least 6 months now. Usually the food is delicious. TODAY\'S ORDER WAS AN ABOMINATION. First and foremost the order was late. We ordered around 1 pm and did not receive the order until after 2:15 PM. The two Chicken Parmesan sandwiches were burnt to the point of being black. As 1 co-worker said "the chicken was as black as the street. The chicken fingers were also burnt. The fries on the combo platters were burnt. The mozzarella sticks were so over cooked that there was no cheese inside of them. We were also missing the fruit punch from one of the combos. All of the food was inedible which is ridiculous. $80 down the drain my office will never order from them again. This entire order was a disappointment. Decent food and quick service. I ordered the mild wings and Caesar salad. My fiancé ordered a burger meal, and it was tasty as well. We\'ve ordered out from Burger Lane a few times, and the first time it was absolutely delicious. Most recently, however, the quality of food has taken a noticeable nose dive. I ordered my go-to, which was the Rockadelphia burger. The first time I ordered it, the Texas Toast was scrumptious as heck - crispy on the outside and fluffy and delicious. \n\nThis time, however, it was like they just shoved a lamb patty in between two thicker-than-usual pieces of bread. They were not toasted at all. The caramelized onions were so sweet I had to pick them off (and I have a sweet tooth, so that\'s saying something). This left me with a lamb patty and very little cheese. Which would be fine... but the lamb was over-cooked, dense, and dry. Not at all what I had come to expect from Burger Lane. \n\nMy partner ordered their signature burger. First, there was no sauce. The bun was not toasted and soggy. The onion rings were more of an onion and bread scramble. He stated "the thing I enjoyed most about my meal was the Sprite." \n\nBy the end of the meal, I took to eating the fries to salvage my dinner. At the start of the meal, I ate a fry and thought "this is okay." But they seemed to get better over time when compared to the meat that was passed off as burgers. We won\'t be ordering from Burger Lane again. Food was good and fresh. Service was good as well, the manager made sure my order was ready in a timely manner and was satisfied. Will be returning. SUPPORT OUR BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES. \nGreat, now that I\'ve gotten that off my chest, let us begin. So the mister and I ordered dinner from here last night via ubereats. The fried pickles were good, they had a nice crunchy corn meal coating on them. I would  like there to have been a sauce with that but otherwise it was good. We both had the build your own burgers. His on potato bread and mines on texas toast. Hubby said his was delish ( i didn\'t get to try as he unhailed it lol). Mines on texas toast was ok but the bread was underdone and left a funny aftertaste. Aside from that it was good and had all the requested toppings. I ordered onion rings and they subbed me fries without atleast telling me sooooo I was a lil peeved about that. Lastly the strawberry milkshake was absolutely fire I was mad when i got to the end of it and there wasn\'t more! The strawberry milkshake was everything- perfectly creamy, not too sweet, just right. I suggest you try them yourself, see how you feel about it. Don\'t treat them like burger king folks, let\'s be a little more gracious than that.\nI will be returning/reordering. Worse burger I\'ve had in a long time I ordered the bacon and blue burger, somehow they managed to forget the blue cheese.  None the less the blue cheese wouldn\'t have made it any better.  The burger was severely overcooked it was like trying to eat through leather.  The bacon was hard and chewy like jerky.  We also ordered the rockadelphia which was equally as bad the Texas toast was soggy and chewy, the burger was like a rock.  The fries were soggy and salty, the onion rings may have been good but all of the breeding fell off the moment we tried to bite into them. We ordered combos ,imagine our surprise to get two cups of watered down soda, apparently they don\'t have bottled beverages so they sent two cups of soda full of ice. By the time our food was delivered the ice had completely melted.  This place is horrible, I do not recommend them at all. Worst burger I\'ve ever had. Literally in my entire life. Dry, tasteless and cold. Also forgot the \'combo\' part of our \'combo\'. Poor customer service and my order was wrong and delivered 45 minutes late. Said I was going to be refunded and haven\'t been. Told me to call back and ignored my calls. Food was mediocre for the price. Wouldn\'t recommend. I mean it\'s dominos & they sell you pizzas for $5.99 what do you expect ? Honestly . I have ordered from them 3 times this week & all of my pizzas , wings and cheese sticks have come to me cooked perfectly. None raw . Probably because I tip , who knows . But my kids love pizza & I will continue to order from them . They always do a good job for me. Famous, the manager, gave me a replacement pizza when they made a mistake. Make sure to use the online coupons for a great deal! I\'m one of their regulars and the food is pretty consistent. Their BBQ chicken pizza with thin crust and Chicken Alfredo pasta are amazing! We order from them weekly and delivery is pretty fast. I don\'t know why the reviews are so low because they never disappoint me. the service here along with the pizza is terrible. the ONLY positive experience I\'ve had here was with ONE of their delivery drivers who was sent to my house on two occasions. nice, tall, slim, young guy. I am sorry for you, dominos delivery driver, because it seems you work with a bunch of lazy assholes.\nnot to mention the young Indian manager who works there visibly treats the employees poorly. it pains me to even give this place a single star. truly. everyone is rude and even if the food was halfway decent, it isn\'t worth it to order and be forced to deal with the incompetent employees. fuck dominos. I attempted to order lunch from this dominos for delivery and a driver named Jeff insisted that he couldn\'t find me so he wouldn\'t complete my order. I asked him to gps my work address and he refused. I guess he let his pride get in the way of using a gps to find the customer instead he just wanted to use his street wits which came up short. He also insisted that I just cancel the order since he didn\'t know where my address was. Great job Jeff. The manager of this store attacked a volunteer who was removing his illegal bandit signs.   See here: http://www.banditproject.org/MonoX/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?newsid=0526117c-aa7a-4051-afed-9f830145fa63 I am from out of town and my boyfriend ordered food after a hockey game. We have never had an issue ordering from Dominos in our hometowns until we ordered from here. They made our pizza wrong. I tried called the store three times before the fourth time I got through. I was put on hold three times to get my issue resolved and I was on hold for a very long time. They said they would send the pizza right out. I know it\'s a Saturday night but it took over an hour to get a  replacement pizza. I got the pizza well after midnight. I am not happy. When I called to see where the pizza was, the gentleman (sounded arrogant) have me an attitude because I was asking when the pizza was getting here and when they left and just hung up on me. Dominos is by far my favorite chain pizza place. They have a forever special of $5.99, for any two topping pizzas, when two are ordered. This location is the most consistent, in my experience. Now go get you some cheesy, yummy goodness. Ordered pizza online. Wait time wasn\'t bad like30-40 min...  the pizza was white one one side, stuck to the cardboard box and not cooked!! .... called to let them know , the manager answered and was very nice saying he would personally make us another pizza and have it delivered right away... 25-30 min later the pizza is here! Yeay... but not really.. again not cooked! So I gave up! Not even calling back... I refuse... so I put the new pizza in the oven and called it a night! My husband is so upset he don\'t even want it. Would not recommend ordering from here. Came with the wrong order and when I called back the delivery guy is with the manager in the background laughing it up meanwhile my food wasn\'t being made. Over a two hour process. And still no food This store is so rude and disrespectful! I called 3 times and a young lady answered and kept saying where close knowing that they wasn\'t and I already placed an order. When I called off another phone she was disrespectful the first time. The second time I got the manager he act like he couldn\'t pull up my order at first and the young lady was in the back yelling and being disrespectful. Her name is Elise and I believe she should hit through training again or be fired. CHILD IF I COULD GIVE THEM 0 STARS I WOULD! LETS START WITH IF YOU WANNA DOE OR GET AN DISEASE then be my guest and eat there! first and foremost they\'re the closest pizza store near me because of the Pizza Hut getting closed down i nearly have an okay experience i only go to them if I\'m really really hungry and nothing else is open but after 12/04/2018 that has been done they OFFICALLY LOST ME AS AN CUSTOMER! so i ordered an pizza and 8 wings with ranch , they never give you the sauce so i don\'t even know why they ask you for an selection! but anyway i only ate the pizza so then the next day i came home I\'m like omg yesss i have the mild wings from yesterday that i didn\'t touch coooooolllll i can\'t wait to enjoy them tell me WHY THE FUCK? the delivery man delivered wings that was already eaten! THATS SO DISGUSTING AND I KNOW THEYRE CARELESS OFF THE FACT THAT WHEN I GO IN THERE THEY NOT WHERE THEY SUPPOSED TO BE AND DOING SOMETHING ELSE! Wow, Friday night 9:30pm March 19, 2021. Please if anyone from headquarters is reading this, the people working there should be fired. The girl inside the store answering the calls made 2 times a mistake with the order and couldn\'t care less. Left without pizza after waiting for 1 hour. The worst people ever, it\'s disgusting. I\'m waiting for my order right now. It\'s been about 40min. Not a big deal but when I called to check on my order the guy was rude with a very bothered careless attitude. I\'m concerned for the quality of my food now. He told me he had no drivers there. I asked how far is he from my hotel. He seemed annoyed that I even asked that question. Bad customer service which means it could be bad food but we\'ll see . Not a good feeling.\n\nUpdate, it\'s been an hour and no pizza yet. I called and was on hold until I was just cut off. I paid by credit card. Lesson learned. I\'ll never do that again!!!\n\n1:20 min pizza showed up barley warm. I recommend look elsewhere. If I could put zero stars i would.  This place is grosssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed at a nearby hotel while visiting and it was late and we were hungry so we ordered from here but we should have listened to the one review that was on point. When the pizza came it was very undercooked and so greasy it was almost inedible but when you\'re hungry and you\'re left with no choice you have to make the best of it looking back I wish we just starved and not eaten it because it got us really sick !!!! Its place should  be condemned and shut down !! This is a warning do not order from here go to 711 and get a taquito instead you\'re better off lol  SEE PHOTOS Very bad service. We ordered 2 pizzas and there was hardly any sauce and one of the pizzas was just made wrong. \n\nWe called and they said they would send us another BUT we had to pay another delivery charge. Again, not okay, but we said okay. Pizzas were delivered. One of them was right but the other was someone else\'s pizza. Looks like they\'re not going to be happy tonight either. Called again, and they gave us a refund finally but who knows because it hasn\'t hit our account yet. \n\nBy the way, let your delivery drivers know it\'s not okay to blow up our phones to try to redeliver an incorrect pizza that\'s already been in our house to deliver to another house. Not that it\'s ever okay, but we are in a pandemic right now.\n\nFor the woman below that said "its dominos, what do you expect", I feel really sorry for the terrible food that you have had to eat your entire life that you think this food or their service is acceptable and shame on you for stuffing your kids with it. You probably work there. Waited 3 hrs for food every time I call it was something different about the driver. No good working ethics. People is rude. Like I\'m not paying for the food. If I could give 0 stars I would worst service ever. Better go to little cesars right around the corner from them. Hmmm... where do I start... \n1. my pick up order was nearly an hour late\n2. two of the workers started yelling and fighting with each other with very COLORFUL language (definitely not a family friendly place)\n3. Floors and counters were clearly not up to COVID-19 sanitary requirements and were frankly disgusting \n\nOverall I\'d say I\'m genuinely disappointed and will not be ordering from there again. I suggest you stay clear. :) This domino location food is good so I don\'t know what the people below me is talking about. The workers are nice & respectful as long as you come with respect and love than they will give you the same thing. They are young workers so give them a chance to grow and improve on what they doing. I will surly be back time and time again! Customer service was horrible. I had called to tell them about two separate orders that was delivered to the wrong address and they hung up on me. Domino must not care about their franchise. They have some ghetto unprofessional hoodlums answering the phone. Unacceptable. I would never order from this franchise ever again. This domino\'s has its ups and downs some days they cook well some days they don\'t. The pizza I ordered today was undercooked and it tasted very doughy and it seemed that they slabbed on as much sauce as they possibly could to the point the pizza pie was hard to take a slice from. Whoever cut the pizza did an awful job because I had to cut the pizza myself. In addition, I was missing every dipping cup we ordered. When I called customer service they gave me an attitude and didn\'t even apologize for the inconvenience. If I could I\'d give this 0 stars I would. Never received my order. So hard to get in touch with store. Manager kept saying driver delivered it. He may have delivered it but not to the correct person. Manager said they are backed up so they are just going to give me a refund, even though I would\'ve just wanted my order re delivered. Horrible experience! Pizza was hot but too much sauce. Also, why have the curbside option online if you refuse to bring the pizza outside? Horrible customer service. This place gets a negative -3 stars. This place always seem to disappoint me. The only reason why I order from here was because my family needed a meal. Besides them giving me a half eaten pizza before they have completely topped themselves this time by completely forgetting my deliver order. i just don\'t understand how this happen. I legit waited hours no phone call or anything. I finally called them after they hung up on me several times I finally got through and that is when they told me they forgot to deliver my order. I am just so disgusted. I\'m not normally one to write Yelp reviews or go full Karen about a business for that matter but this place is a disaster. I ordered online and after an hour of sitting in the store it was marked delivered.Checked the door and nothing was there. Called the store only to be hung up on the first time and to be put on hold for about 20 minutes the second time I called. When I finally got ahold of someone I was told that it would be there soon and then they hung up. \n\nAfter 2 hours of waiting I got my order that was cold yet somehow burnt. One bite in and it tasted gross as if someone had tampered with my order. Threw it in the trash and ordered a burrito from a local spot. I was never rude with the staff at any point, I tipped well ahead of time, and still got this terrible service.\n\nShould have known that a location with this many bad reviews would disappoint. Not wasting my time with this place again We order here about 1-2 times a month.  Usually online because it\'s such a simpler process than calling in and I just like being able to look at the cute pizza tracker. Lol... Domino\'s isn\'t the best around but it\'s the closest pizza chain nearby. \n\nThe only pizza I wouldn\'t recommend is the thin crust and I live thin crust pizza! But here, the crust is like newspaper thin, anything more than two toppings is a massacre and they slice it into small squares.. Ugh.  The wings are a pass for us too. For some reason, they bake these wings but not long enough so they\'re not even crispy. I\'ve tried them several times but to no avail. I can\'t eat a soggy, baked Buffalo wing.  \n\nDelivery times are very accurate and they have decent drivers. I ordered the meal deal with his six nuggets and fries and BBQ sauce and a large  sweet. Receive my order and I touch my fries and they was cold. Is be young guy in the window to your have any hot fries so I gave him my the cold fries and he hollered back to the person that was cooking. They said yes we have hot fries. So he went back to get them and when he was walking to the window he just hand me the hot fries in this hands. He should have put them in a bag or wrapped a napkin around them so I got another order of fries. I have been at a slowe McDonald\'s in my life. I go there because I work in the mall. With limited time I sat 10 minuted waiting for a soda. I went elsewhere. Unreal Just walk to this mc Donald right now 6:06 am n it\'s still closed n two workers are waiting for it to open so they can start working. Seems like this place is always late when it comes down to opening n also very slow service. This McDonalds is incapable of taking an order. They will mess it up every time. Truly pathetic that you can\'t handle the simplest of tasks. Service was horrible!! Took forever. My order never got put in the system. I just wanted 6 chicken nuggets. A lady behind  me was catering a wedding or something and her order was filled long before mine. Stay away from this Mc Donald\'s. Extremely rude and disrespectful staff. If you ever use the drive thru, they\'ll keep you waiting for 10 or 15 minutes. Also their dining area and the kitchen looks extremely dirty. Often times they\'ll give you cold food. Overall avoid this branch. They say it\'s fast food, but always have to wait so long for food. Should be called slow food, \n\nThe only thing. that\'s great is there $1 menu, \n\nBut when is it comes from one of the cleanest McDonald\'s I\'ve been  to. \n\nThey could do a little better on how they wait on customers and make sure they give them what they order. But other then that it\'s okay. \n\nDon\'t ask for extra sauce for your chicken nuggets because there charge you extra for it. Came here the other night after working a 10 hour shift, really important part of the story here, outside on the McDonald\'s it says \'open till 1 am\' so I pull up to the drivethru at about 12:10 and wait about 2 minutes after saying hello multiple times, I go to the window to see the employees not working and just kinda sitting around, so after waving my arm trying to get the employees attention I honk my horn, a girl noticed and came up to the window and screamed in my face "we closed" I said "on google maps it says 1 am, also says it right outside" she goes "we fucking closed bitch" like 1) eh s\'disrespectful 2) y\'ghetto as fuck 3) terrible customer service 4) if you closed at 12 why is that not readily available for customers Where is the button for NO STARS, or even NEGATIVE STARS? This is the most disgusting McDonald\'s on the face of the earth. The employees were rude and inattentive.  No one seemed to be in charge.  The area behind the counter was FILTHY.  The employees were playing grab-ass and cussing.  Three of the female employees were catering to (fawning over) some dude in a purple suit who was sprawled out in a booth... could he have been the franchise owner?  If so, McDonald\'s needs to send him packing. Filthy, dirty, disgusting. Not exactly a McDonald\'s trademark moment. This place was good before n it\'s bad n getting to the worse. They fight n argue with the customers n the manager just sat and do nothing. For the services you have to wait 2 or 3 minutes on the front of register to get serve, so at least need 20 minutes to get your food The old lady at the drive through taking money was rude af. Yelled at me as if I was doing something wrong. The staff here needs better training. The manager a middle aged indian woman is not at all friendly. Doesnt say thank you. The help around her is not so good either. Even if the goof was worth it i woyldnt go. The manager shoyldnt haveva job with the public. When guests only have one option to enjoy their experience, make it a positive one to the best of your ability. I wanted in a long line, as to be expected. The person in the drive thru kept telling me to move forward, move forward. They have two speakers. There was a car at the speaker in front of me. I couldn\'t move forward. Then after I placed my order, I was instructed to move around the car in front of me and go to the window. What? He was done literally 10 seconds after me. Had I moved in front of him, that would\'ve been wrong and pointless. We both ordered a combo meal. What tops it off for me is though....the delightful, gracious, smiling happy faces that waited around the bend for me. First, to take my money, then second, hand me the bag like I was extending my hand with the virus itself extended to her. No smile. No thank you. No eye contact. And worst of all, no freakin napkins!!!!!  You people are the worst. I\'m not lovin\' it. I got in the drive thru line.  The speaker has the automated after waiting 10 minutes I drove up to the window.  2 cars were in front of me. The hours say open til 11pm. After waiting 10 more minutes and trying to get the attention of several employees who just waved me off I decided to call the store.   The person who answered said they had a problem with the speaker so they closed.  But if I orders Uber eats or door dash I could purchase food.  I suggested maybe putting a sign at the drive thru.  As we were pulling out of the drive thru line the girl out the window yelled to us "are you u we eats".... we said no, then she yelled we are closed the speaker is broke.  I said a lot of things are broke and she proceeded to yell you think your smart.... and they yelled your an asshole.  There were other customers at the window.  This is the epitome of unprofessional behavior. Literally the worst McDonald\'s I have ever been to in my entire life. Pulled up to the drive-through was asked what I wanted then I get cut off after trying to order one burger and was told that I\'m gonna have to wait that she\'s not ready. Then I wait for 15 minutes and no one answers I go to pull out to leave and nobody was in line in front of me. A time before this there always employees cussing and fighting each other. Even had the manager walk up to the person at the first window talking out loud saying she doesn\'t Give a eff if the customers order was wrong, as they are sitting there eating taking orders.  I thought I\'d them a 2nd chance and never again. Came here for a quick lunch and I don\'t know if she was a manager or cashier . But she took my order through drive through & she was super nice and made my day a little bit better.  A coupon wasn\'t excepted and she apologized for it which was totally fine with me. She has great customer service skills and I hope she knows just by her being nice makes people\'s days, like mine better . Absolutely worst! They don\'t even acknowledge customers standing waiting to order. Place is filthy and this was before COVID. New management and staff are needed here Pure fucking idiots they have working here... trust me if you want McDonald\'s go that extra mile and get it from Bristol pike, I can just bet these guys fuck up something anytime we go here ... I\'ve had it I\'m gonna go out of my way next time not to come back. BTW were in the wake of a pandemic and all but one person was wearing the mask improperly. Sure hope me or my family don\'t get sick and I\'ll pray for anyone else that chooses they\'re service If you have the  IQ of a stick , here\'s the place of employment for you... EVERY TIME, I go there, don\'t know why I do, they  screw up  my order... HOW HARD IS IT TO  PUT STUFF IN A BAG?? Rob me every single time.. Place should be closed down... GOOD  JOB MANAGER!! Morons!!!!!! This place should be permanently closed down. That would actually be a service to everyone. This is absolutely the WORST McD\'s in NE Philly. I went to the drive thru and ordered a Nugget meal. The idiot who gave me my bag was more interested in talking to her coworkers. I asked for sweet and sour sauce to which she said it\'s in there (it\'s f\'ing bbq sauce!) To make matters worse, there were no fries in my bag even though I already paid and they come with my meal. I wouldn\'t wish my worst enemy eat here except for puta who gave me my order in the drive thru. Morning crew is pretty good. They are quick and make all the drinks the correct way. Afternoon crew is extremely slow and always mess things up. I will not be going back since I work nights Horrible customer service from......no other than Alam the manager.  Then to top it off they didn\'t put the lid on but instead just placed it on top! I grab my coffee and turn around to leave and of course pop goes the lid and hot coffee pour out all over my arm hand and legs!!  Sorry alam but it\'s time to find a better career maybe pizza delivery boy?!? Getting truly friendly service at a fast food restaurant is rare, let alone one on Grey\'s Ferry. \n\nI\'ve never been inside of this DD so I can\'t comment on that and the drive thru is actually kind of terrifying (just where it is from a location perspective). But the service that I received the last few times actually surprised me because it was so friendly and warm. Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t have extremely high expectations for a DD drive thru but right away I was greeted with a friendly hello and as I went through my order (which was long and annoying), the woman was attentive, kind and referred to me as "sweetie", which is weird to some people but I thought it was really nice. \n\nWhen I pulled up, the gentleman at the window was also very friendly and quick. I received my long order in just a few minutes and the interaction ended with a "have a great day?" I got home and everything I ordered was well prepared. I also like that this DD puts the cream cheese on the bagel instead of giving you a knife and tub of cream cheese for you to put on yourself. \n\nI really appreciated the great service here! This location is unorganized and the parking sucks. The service is slow and unforgiving. A coworker of mine asked for his bagel to be cut in 4s when it wasn\'t cut at all he complained and was told to never come back. Who gets banned from a dunkin donuts for life. so I\'m not a huge fan pa the neighborhood is awful. Wowww. I had to throw out my iced coffee because the coffee tasted like something went terribly wrong somewhere along the way. I\'m pretty sure she knew it was terrible because she added an INSANE amount of sugar to compensate. The bathroom is so dirty that it\'s almost a joke (see the picture)\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID When I worked near University City, I stopped here occasionally, but 8 out 10 times, coffee always had strong burnt odor. I initially thought it was due to toothpaste or chewing gum. But nope, that\'s not the case. And few workers have rough attitudes (e.g., yelling, looking at you funny if it takes more than 10 seconds to get money out). The worst. They have messed up my order the last three times I\'ve gone. The wait is always ridiculous even during non peak times. It\'s at a convenient location. That\'s about it. Who charges .50 for a jelly pack! And the worker had their nerve to say it with an attitude\u200d where is the customer service now a days? Super slow. Consistently handed the wrong order. Better off driving to 18th St Dunkin\n\nEdit: these people cannot get an order right to save their lives. PAY ATTENTION TO THE DAMN SLIP. Horribly slow line. Friendly staff. Morning and night. They have only messed up my coffee once in the 7 months I\'ve been going there. \nIt\'s sometimes slower at night. I\'ve heard more customers being rude or yelling at the speaker than i have seeing the employee being rude. Working fast food isn\'t enjoyable, so ease up yelling at them, and maybe your coffee would be correct. There are some weeks I go through drive-thru here every weekday morning for a cup of coffee (usually black), and sometimes an everything bagel w/ cream cheese (YUM!).  Even with a long line, I\'m usually back onto I76 within 10 minutes with my coffee.  The lady at the window could probably sweeten my coffee just looking at it, she\'s so nice.  Occassionally, the flavor is slightly burnt, but it\'s on point most of the time. This is my morning rush hour detour spot. lol. Coffee and a bagel for my drive to work. The staff is friendly and helpful. Never had a problem with my food or the staff here. Great drive through spot. It\'s really a hit or miss. I\'ve never had problems with mobile orders through the drive thru except for at midnight. Even though it\'s 24 hours, they lock the doors at nights so I\'m assuming only drive-thru is 24 hours. Don\'t go to this store #300230. Owner is cheapskate who always try to swindle out or DD Perks deals. They tend to make up excuses like they run out materials or their machine broke so they don\'t have to sell you what\'s included in the deals. When they make an error in the cash register, they claim they can\'t cancel or void the sale. Terrible management all around. I had a horrible exchange this morning with a cashier at the 3313 Wharton st Phila store Dunkin\' Donuts. I simply ordered a grill cheese sandwich and ask for bacon on it. While ordering she was rushing me saying do you want ham do you want this I said one second I would like to have the sweet black pepper bacon. She then went on to say that you can\'t have that. I said well why not I should be able to have whatever I can pay for and I also ordered this all the time from other Dunkin\' Donuts. So she said to me who do you think you\'re talking to and I thought wow what a horrible exchange. I ask for a manager she said yeah I\'ll get a manager the manager then proceeded to take my order and said so they\'ll be a little extra for the bacon I said not a problem I\'m sure I can afford it I just don\'t understand why your agent told me I couldn\'t have whatever I wanted to order. I have never been spoken to like this when I\'m spending my money and I don\'t believe that anything was done. So I did not take this order, I wasn\'t sure what would be safe to consume. Additionally I was in the drive-through for such a long time and during Covid you would think people would be understanding and even more accommodating. I hope this response to get some traction,Now I am very busy and I don\'t have time to do these reviews but this had to be submitted the Philadelphia grays ferry location I will never go there again. The food and service is always great. My number one complaint is the drive through. The line is always long and hangs out into traffic. I know that\'s not DD\'s fault for such a crappy road to be on and people are sooooo impatient. \nBut I\'m happy to get my sweet tea at DD! I like Papa John\'s pizza. I had to get that out of the way so you would know I\'m not rating it this bad for the quality of the food. The service at this place is the so wonderfully terrible it can not be described with words. Enjoy your pizza 4 hours after you order it. It will be there in 15 mins even if its only a 2 min drive. Going in to take out was no better. It\'s faster but you\'ll leave just as disgusted. The only Papa John\'s worse than this one is the one in the movie Killa Season. Ok.. I don\'t really like Papa John\'s pizza but they had an online deal for a large pizza really cheap so I ordered it online.  It was easy, but that has nothing to do with this particular shop.\n\nWhat was great was the delivery!!  I live in a large complex that spans a couple acres where it\'s hard to find the apartments because everything has the same street address.  The delivery man called on the phone, was well spoken, intelligent, and courteous.  He understood my directions and found me very quickly.\n\nPlus I ordered on a Saturday night and they were here in 15 minutes. \n\nIf I want crap American style pizza with very little effort I would definitely order here again Worst place to order pizza. I always order from here and they always take forever to deliver. What\'s funny is that I live practically 15 mins away. The last time I order from this particular place was a total disaster. We waited 3 hours and still didn\'t get the pizza. I kept calling and then i spoke to the manager Liz and she was a total b*tch. She was completely rude and then she hung up on me. They didn\'t even apologize for screwing up. Never ordering from them again. We really need to stop ordering from here, because it\'s just been going downhill. The deals are sometimes good enough (and I\'m frequently lazy enough) that I conveniently forget how soggy and boring their pizzas are and order two or three anyway. And is it just me, or are they getting stingier and stingier with their toppings? The pineapple on my last pizza was the size of corn and there was one sad anchovy per slice. We ordered three different pizzas, and they all looked the same because they were so overwhelmingly just cheese.\n\nThey also kind of suck about confirming online orders, so you end up having to call them anyway. Effort, blech. Look, Papa John\'s pizza is fine.  I\'m no pizza connoisseur; in my opinion Papa John\'s is better than most chain pizza delivery places. The service at this location, though, is fantastically bad.  We ordered pizza at 6:45.  I\'ll spare you the agonizing details, and end with...at 11:15, after we had gone to sleep, the delivery guy calls and say\'s he\'ll be there in a minute. Even in the middle of lunchtime on a weekday, food is cold-old. With that odor associated with something that as waited too long, where flavor transmutes to an impatient attitude. You could maybe account for this by imagining the burger, fries, and fish sandwich had been prepared at some suburban McDonalds and then trucked over to this urban outlet to be re-heated and allow to age a bit. This is an insult to the neighborhood. Cherry Berry Chillers and Smoothies been goood....but I always spiked dem with some ciroc thou. This McDonalds would not have any stars if it wasnt for the actual food tasting pretty good  and looking presentable, as compared to some fast food places that throw a burger together.  \nI placed an order through the mobile order app, and 1 order was for a buttermilk crispy sandwich which went smoothly and the 2nd order was for an Oreo frappe and fries Just like any other time that I would do a mobile order I approach the drive-through and simply told the employee that I had ordered a mobile order and I would simply give a reference number and my order would be complete. This time, I pulled up to the window and had to repeat several times my order my order number and so on and so forth after about three times the lady just stop talking she didn\'t respond after several attempts to get her attentionSo I pull up to the next window and the gentleman was very polite and he did say that he wasn\'t quite sure about the mobile order and that I should come inside so I decide to do so. Once I came inside not only was the woman who I spoke with extremely rude at that point as well I also came to find she was a manager. I was approached with "you got the crispy chicken right?" And threw the bag down I told her yes I was but I had also ordered another item the Oreo frappe and french fries and it was her comment that was my shocking and she says well I didn\'t see that on my screen. So I was not going to receive that Oreo frappe or french fries X even after showing this manager my receipt on my mobile app for payment. The manager that time said it was not her problem was I had paid for it or not it was not her screen so it\'s not heProblem I told her it indeed was her problem and in fact does not mind considering she was the manager there now mom story short they were extremely extremely unprofessional they had the least amount of class I\'ve seen in a very long time and just very very rude \nAnd that\'s all without mentioning I didn\'t recieve my fries I paid for or the credit fowards buy 5 McCafé/ 1 free Would give this place negative stars if possible... just wanted a coffee... sat in the drive thru for over 30 minutes.... they are either severely understaffed or do not understand the workflow... I\'ve worked at a fast food chain before and never have seen this before. There was only 2 cars in front of me. It\'s bad because I sat here writing this review as I am waiting for the coffee. Highly depressing and it sucks since it\'s a multi billion dollar chain, it won\'t get changed... One of the worst places I\'ve been to. Me and my boyfriend decided to get a bundle box, and when the cashier who attended us called us over, who might I add had no skills at all in talking to any customer except their hood rat friends, I tried to ask him what the box was called (since we never actually knew the name) and he just kept saying " I don\'t know". And then he proceeded to just say that he was joking and stuff and told us the name so we ordered. We noticed it didn\'t come with drinks so we just stood back in line and he was literally behind that drinks on his phone. It took his Manager or whoever to let him know that we were there. He came over and I told him I wanted a Sweet Tea and he rudely asked me if that was all. Not even gonna lie, this man seemed high and completely detached from what he was doing. But anyway we sat down because we kinda assumed it would take a minute since we ordered the box. About 15 minutes went by and we still didn\'t get our food, but I noticed a bundle box behind the counter but wasn\'t sure if it was ours. 5 more minutes go by,so I decide to go up to the counter so they could see I was waiting. The cashier that attended us asked if I was waiting for something and I told him our bundle box, he picked up the bundle box that was sitting there for the longest time and gave it to us. As I grabbed the food I said "So it\'s just been sitting there the whole time" and walked away and as I was walking away some girl is gonna say that it\'s not her fault because she called out the number and no one came. Usually the workers yell out the number, and neither me or my boyfriend heard her say anything at all. And the food wasn\'t good at all. It was just nasty and the fries were almost stale. It was just really disgusting and the place smelled bad too. They need to throw the whole restaurant away. We always avoid this location because they just can\'t get it together. Once we waited at least 5 minutes at the drive thru just for them to tell us their drive thru is closed due to short staffed. Any other time we still have to wait at least 5 minutes to get to the order speaker then it\'s at least 2 minutes til someone ask what you\'d like to order. By then the kids are anxious and starving so we leave and go to the Wendy\'s down the street Just went in and ordered 10 cherseburgers. Manager on duty had a very nasty attitude. The drive thru was already backed up so i went inside thinking it may have been faster....NOT! I still waited patiently and then placed my order...mgr said to coworkers that my order was going to back them up further. I shouldnt be made to feel like its my fault you cant run your line more efficiently because of what I ordered. My only complaint is with the manager that was working on 8/21/16 @ 12:15pm. Very rude. Other employees were very polite and accommodating. This place is ridiculous. We ordered out food at 8:20. Its now 9:15. When we got to the window they never even started on our food. Cars behind us was yelling at us like it\'s out fault. All we ordered was there big Macs and two Apple pie. When we got to the window they said they had no more apple pie. How do you charge someone something and then tell them they don\'t have it.\n\nThey are either very under employed or they are completely disorganized but definitemy will never come back here again. This place is very unorganized and borderline unsanitary. No matter the temperature there are always flies buzzing around. Every few months I decide to give them the benefit of the doubt and each time I decide to eat elsewhere. Take a 5 minute drive to Oxford Circle instead Hate this place... void this place at all cost! This is not my first time being disappointed but of course I had to give them another try. I was in the drive-thru Sat.night 10/22/2017 there was along line there but of course the kid\'s and I just wanted McDonald\'s and waited. I arrived at the drive-thru  at 11:40pm at 11:57pm the woman took my order of:8 cheeseburgers, 2 med. fries, a small frie, two sm. cokes. Only to have her say, "we don\'t got no cheeseburgers and we\'re about to close." After all that wait time. My thought was I\'m at McDonald\'s but I was just so mad. What a great disappointment!!!!! A BIG THANK-YOU TO COTTMAN AVE. MCDONALD\'S WHO WERE MORE ACCOMMODATING WHERE I SHOULD HAVE WENT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!! The chicken is good but they will cheat you; I got 2 drumstick wings instead of 2 chicken legs in my 12 piece bucket.  I\'m done because they don\'t answer their phone and it was an obvious attempt to deceive. I\'m a DoorDash driver, I recently got a job to pick up an order for a customer at this location. I waited 30 minutes to just pick up apple slices and a 10 piece McNuggets meal. People came in after me and got their orders quicker, and they were much bigger.  I didn\'t even have to eat here to know the experience of just being here is so terrible WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! Waited in the drive thru at least 30 mins just to place my order, the manager that took the order ABSOLUTELY HATES HIS JOB!!!! All attitude. Finally get to the window after another 15 mins, food is STILL not ready, there are uber eats and/or door dash guys standing outside the drive thru window waiting for food, note I said STANDING outside of the window, which is a safety hazard. There was no control over what was going on. The manager again with the attuitude, when asked for my receipt, he gave me the wrong one with more attitude, finally after waiting another 10 -12 minutes I get my food which was a happy meal with cold fries. Absoutely avoid this Mc Donalds if at all possible. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE !!!!\nI am not kidding when i say these people are lazy. It could be 8pm and just to not serve milkshakes or Mc floris they will tell you their machine is broken. THEY ARE LIARS because during the day they serve them but any time after 8 it\'s "broken" ? Not only that but they constantly get orders wrong and I\'ve been inside and it\'s completely disgusting.. I wish I can give this place 0 stars 99% of the workers there look like they need to go to rehab and act like your there asking for free food they need to fire everyone there disgusting attitudes  an horrible service This McDonalds used to be one of the best in Philadelphia, but has seriously gone down hill. The manager JoAnne actually wanted to charge me for ice that I put in my own cup. (As an FYI I usually have Ice in my INSULATED cup but I hadn\'t filled it up and just fill the cup I get from them with tea to put in it) \n\nThis isn\'t a problem at the two McDonalds in South Philly or any other McDonalds that I\'ve been to. So I didn\'t expect it to be an issue here, especially since I\'ve frequented it often for the past 25 years. Honestly...I just wanted an ice  coffee and what I got was unexplainable. I don\'t know what it is but it tasted like fake syrup with a tiny bit of coffee mix with orange juice. Terrible! The customer service was terrible as well.  Will never come back here ever again. Bad service and bad store..i order too much things ,and paid for money, but the store don\'t give me enough food , such as :no French fries,no large hot tea,no large  iced tea ,no 6 PC buttermilk crispy chicken tenders meal ,,I paid the money,but don\'t give me them,I am angry and unhappy!!I don\'t like the store !!! Nice place. You occasionally get your average screw up but never alot. Also it can get very crowded during the afternoon and during weekends. Sunday is a no-go. When it isn\'t that crowded it is a good place. Can\'t say great though. Some hygiene problems... Every time we have to clean our own table. Just went here today one of the best McDonald\'s I\'ve been to fries were AMAZING! Best I\'ve had in a very long time\n\nHad to revise! The fries were so good I went back for seconds only this time only 15 minutes later they were disgusting a pound of salt nasty flavor inedible, then I noticed my receipt and the drive in front of mines order on the screen.. No matter if you get a small soda or a McFlurry any drink they will add a 50 cent up charge with or without meal that is theft! Also I ordered the first fries with a coupon the second time they charged me $4.09 I think crazy high it\'s like 2.85 after tax around my way They have very rude staff and offers very bad service. In addition to that my last visit included being accused of lying about my order resulting in me being charged wrong.  Fun times. the Cashier charged me the wrong amount (the total dollar amount for the car behind me). the  cashier did not verify that it was the correct order but simply swiped my card. It get worse as the same cashier says it is not her mistake but mine because I was supposed to know my order.  She started to argue with me until she back off. she did cause a scene for no reason.\nhint: It helps if you comfirm what was ordered.\nthey did correct the problem and refunded on the spot.\nI checked the order when I go home and my order was missing food.  My daughters happy was not a very happy. It was missing the toy and her small fries.  \noverall, it was a pretty horrible experience.  I would give zero stars if it was not for the fact that the food I did get was able to feed my daughter and I. Worst service ever!!!! I never got my food!!!! I called them twice for them to tell me my food already on its way for 2 hours already smfh I ordered a med pizza with pepperoni & mushrooms and 2 gyro platters on grubhub. When I finally got my order, which took a little over an hour, the food was cold and my pizza didnt have any pepperoni on it. When I called the restaurant I spoke with manager who agreed to send me another pizza but was very adamant about me sending the wrong pizza back to him. I told him I didnt eat it and was willing to send it back. Another 50 mins later, I called because I hadnt received my new pizza yet. He said that the pizza was on its way and again told me he wants his pizza back and immediately hung up the phone on me. The food is usually good but their customer service sucks. Don\'t be mad at the customer if you messed up! I usually order from here atleast once or twice a month but I think I\'m going to take my business somewhere else now. This place was great when they first open but now it\'s getting worse and worse. My food was horrible. I\'ve ordered a cheese steak with everything in it, it came out dried and looks like it had barely anything it it, it was also smushed. My hot buffalo wings was not even hot cuz all the sauce leaked out of the container they were in so I had dried wings. My food looked disgusting. I will not be ordering from here ever again. Pizza is good. The pepperoni pizza isnt as greasy/oily as most places. It tastes pretty good to me. Delivery doesnt take too long either. I don\'t know why people rate Feltonville so poorly. The pizza is good and so are the cheesesteaks. Delivery time is pretty fast as well. Hated it!!!! I ordered online and when I received my order,  it was totally wrong. The shake I ordered was watery and beyond nasty. The hoagie had items on it that I did not request and was missing items that I asked for. I couldn\'t even enjoy it. What a frickin waste of money. When I called to inform them about the mishap, no one knew how to fix the issue and they basically did not care. They told me to contact the online ordering system for a credit. They have piss poor customer service and I will NEVER ever order from there again. That\'s what I get for ordering from some hole in the wall anyway. I should have looked at the reviews beforehand.  It won\'t happen again. smh... Awful service here. I had a $52.81 order through Grub Hub. My order was missing curly fries. I called the restaurant and was told that their Grub Hub paper didn\'t have curly fries on it. I later spoke to a Marilyn through Grub Hub and was made to feel like a liar. She repeatedly told me that the restaurant manager only charged me $48, even though the delivery guy said $52.81.\n\nIn the end, all I wanted was a reimbursement code for the curly fries for future orders. But, Marilyn didn\'t want to listen to me. She took the side of the restaurant and didn\'t even bother apologizing or anything.\n\nThe restaurant people are liars. Grub Hub\'s CS are a bunch of incompetent morons. We\'ve spent hundreds and hundreds through Grub Hub and this is the sh*tty way they treat us.\n\nYou two get an F-! This pizzeria is around the corner from me. Just to be an ok place not great by any means but acceptable. However the place since has taking a nose dive last few times ive ordered. Don\'t get the wings they are just barely passable. They use to have a wing-ding platter which would feed two an was pretty good they stopped that. Hoagies arent too good the pizza is still acceptable. The counter girls are generally nice an one of them has a nice "personality" to her...lol You know, its really hard for me to write something horrible about a place because generally there is always something good.  Well I have to make an exception - if i can describe this place in one word it would be a DUMP!!!\nNo question there are serious health violations in this place. It was dirty, disgusting, and it smelled horrible.  I had my son and his friend with him, we were coming home from the museum and we were hungry. We wanted to go into a place where we could sit down and eat pizza.  I had no idea that it would be the hardest thing to do. Everything I found (about 10) places, only had take out no tables to set.  I should\'ve just eat in the city, anyway as I treaked my way up to drop off my sons friend in northeast philly I remembered about this place.  I haven\'t been there in about 30 years so when i drove by and saw it open I was suprised.  So I went in - what a dump, the floor look like they haven\'t seen a mop in 30 years, it looks like the place hasn\'t been cleaned in 30 years.  I sat down and no one came to me so i went to the counter and the most unprofessional person asked what I wanted.  I asked for a MENU and she gave it to me.  I ordered a pizza, fries and cheesesteak.  I went to go sit with the boys and as I sat there I really looked at this place.  i almost got up and left unfortunatly I already paid for the food and they charged me and extra $1 to use my card.  After 15 min that felt like an hour, they had my food wrapped up ready to go.  I told it was to eat in the just looked at me wth a deer in headlights look. I just said forget and sat the sticky seats.  i asked for a fork and knife and they looked at me with a glare once again.  The girl said she would TRY TO FIND SOMETHING.  After a while she found those packs with a napkin, fork and knife in them.  The pizza was horrible, it had so much oil or grease not sure floating top of the pizza I used about 50 napkins to get the grease off - the crust wasn\'t cooked all the way..  The Fries were not cooked all the way as well and the cheesesteak was dry and hard  As I sat and tried to eat to the food I was praying the kids wouldn\'t get sick off this horrible food (they didn\'t they were fine). If the Health Department is reading this - you guys need to shut this place down, at least pay them a visit.  Stay away from this place unless your used to this - I say that because there phone was ringing off the hook.  I guess people like there food - poor souls. I\'ve ordered from this place before but today is the worst. It took almost 2 hours to get my food and to top it off there were items missing. The pizza was cold , the "cold" beverages were hot. I called to tell them about my missing item , they told me it will be 5 minutes. 30 minutes later I got my missing item. They offered no apologies, no future discount, nothing. I will NOT be ordering from this pizzeria anymore. If I could give it a lower rating I would. Very dissatisfied. This place need to be Shut the fuck down i spent 37 on some Nasty ass food i called in at 7:15 my cold ass food came at 8:30 how is that Good Food the  yall got my Food Wrong!! the chick answering phones Gonna get a nice fade when i see her Rate a fucking 0 Only ate from here because everything was closed never ordering from here again! The bleu cheese was spilled all in the bag, they forgot my drink, and the wings ha I order from Feltonville Express Pizza twice this week. The first time I ordered for lunch, I was suppose to get a free can soda. After I paid and tipped the driver I realized I didn\'t get my soda, so I ran back to the door and told him. He said I\'ll be right back, drove off, never returned.\n\nToday I ordered for dinner. Three different people got on the phone so I had to give my order three times. The order was not made to my specification. When I called back to complain, the employee on the phone went back and forth with me about what I ordered rather than apologizing and offering a replacement order or credit. What ever happened to good customer service? They will never get my money again; I am very displeased. Very long delivery time .coldish,room temp  pizza ,definitely not hot .no pizza bags used ?\nAlso cheese fries are 5 bucks ,and the quantity is lacking ...\n\nThe young lady who answers the phone is always pleasant ,and helpful ... Very disappointed with the food. I ordered a small pizza with extra cheese and a lasagna. The pizza had no sauce and the crust seems like it was made of pre-frozen dough. The lasagna had no lasagna noodles. It was just a platter of a huge glop of ricotta cheese in the center sauce, sausage and mozzarella cheese. Everything was cold and extremely greasy. This is the first time ordering from here and definitely the last. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Customer service sucks , they sound really unprofessional I ordered from here a couple times and never had someone speak to me the way the young lady did , you guys should start rehiring new girls , preferably respectful because your customer service is horrible! I\'m just rating this place 1 star because everyone else does and it\'s the number 1 worst place to eat in Philly according to Yelp! Also look at all the pictures of bugs in the food... do I really even need to say anything.... So gross. My job order a Pizza lunch for the work from home staff and the Pizza was really great  They ordered me a small but We could of eaten a large New management, thick dough pizzas, and lack of flavor. Used to be good but not up to the expectations I\'ve had before for this pizza shop. I ordered breakfast for my family and I have a large family so you would think that for a $70 order we would at least get syrup and butter. Well we didn\'t. The breakfast foods were kind of okay but not great. We called to inform them they forgot our condiments and were told they would bring them to us. We are still waiting the next day. I wouldn\'t order from here again. Great food but didn\'t like the taste of the waffles I had. Other than that, it had been  good place to get some food. Fast delivery on most nights aswell. Solid food albeit incredibly rude over the phone. \nAfter calling about a miscommunication over the phone the employee answering the phone was rather quick to give attitude without any problem solving techniques refused to be professional. The worst of it was the employee claimed to be the manager! If that\'s how management then there needs to be some rearrangement. This place is horrible. If Chef Ramsey ever came to Philly to do a Kitchen Nightmares special this would be the place to come to. I just ordered a pizza and wings, horrible, just crap. I ordered the "Feltonville special" The cheese didn\'t stick to the crust, they put the pepperonis under the cheese, canned mushrooms, and the wings had a ketchup like sauce mixed with barbecue sauce! Low quality...VERY LOW QUALITY INGREDIENTS! MUSHROOMS ARE LIKE $3 a pound? Y\'all couldn\'t splurge?! SAVE YOUR MONEY. NEVER ORDERING FROM THEM AGAIN. MATTER OF FACT I MADE THIS ACCOUNT RIGHT AFTER RECEIVING THIS CRAP ORDER. Always ordered breakfast from here but today is my last time. Was on the phone for 30 minutes arguing about them sending the wrong thing.Female was persistant on not seeing out digital order and was trying to tell us that we did order the item.When we told them we could bring it up online thats when they sudedenly found it. Also asked for platter back and we wouldnt eat it any way because the cheese was on the french toast.Dont order from here they do not value cuatomer service I live in the neighborhood not more than four blocks from there it took an hour and a half for my food to get there when it did show up my food was cold and have my order wasn\'t even there call the store they said they were going to take care of it and never showed up I will never would have come there again I\'ve ordered a couple times and the food is great. Good delivery time and polite people. Just ordered a burger with a drink and milkshake and I\'m disappointed that they forgot the milkshake. I called them after to tell them that they forgot it, and they told me that they would send someone to deliver it. 2 hours later, and they forgot about it.\n\nlike how The pizza was undercooked bottom line. I ordered a medium with bacon and pepperoni and I\'m sorry to report that the toppings were very scarce. Not cool.\n\nAt least the employees were friendly. Employees walked around and one was on their phone while boxing up my order. I was quite annoyed because I don\'t want people touching their phone when they are touching my food. Plenty of germs when they do something like that. \n\nFood was not bad, but could\'ve been ore flavorful in regards to the special chicken orders. I\'ve never had a problem.. food is always good and delivery is fast! Surprised at all the bad reviews Pretty solid delivery time. They forgot the garlic sauce I ordered as an extra. But overall, it was alright Took an hour and a half to deliver. We had to call twice and their excuse was "it takes long". The location is a mile away from me and it took 45 minutes from when it said it was out for delivery to when it actually arrived. They also tampered with the tracker to make it show as delivered about half an hour before it actually arrived. And of course the pizza was freezing cold when it arrived. Horrible customer service.My order was never delivered . Delivery driver named Andre called to say order is late (duuh) and i asked for a fresh pizza, after which I was hung up on. Store doesnt take any calls and Im forced to go through a credit card dispute.  Id rather get frozen pizza in the microwave than order from here again. Surprise surprise they dont use gloves when preparing the food. This is disgusting!!! Oh then they pick up the phone then go back to preparing food omg.... Ordered the carryout sale special - 2 topping large pizza. Come to bring it home and it\'s not as ordered. No toppings. I should know by now to check fast food orders before leaving, but I trusted they could get this simple order correct.\n\nIt was disgusting, I should have gotten a frozen pizza from the Acme down the road. \n\nAnyhow I called to get a replacement and they handed the phone off to 3 different people. They refused to do anything to make this right. I was hungry so I struggled through a few slices of what was basically bread loaded with cheap sauce and some cheese.\n\nI threw the rest down the garbage chute. Even my garbage chute deserves better.\n\nWill never shop here again. Very fast and clean store compared to other dominos. Customer service is nice the times I\'ve visited, and delivery times aren\'t bad at all. After waiting for an hour and 30 minutes I called to see where the order was. Only to find out they don\'t have the order in their system. The money has already come out of my checking account. He said they could make it and I could pick it up. I waited another 40 minutes to go get it and they said they didn\'t have it. I had to prove to him the money came out of my account. Only to find out he could not give me a refund or my pizza. He told me to call corporate. Of course  no one can answer. Worst experience ever. Oh and every person in there putting cheese on pizzas during corona virus had no gloves on. Horrendous. Always forgets half my order, super rude on the phone and does nothing about it when I\'m upset One of the worst pizzas I\'ve ever had.  Ordered a buffalo chicken pizza because everywhere else around was closed.  They overcooked the pie and then tried to cover it up with a bottleful of the sauce.  Additionally there were next to no cheese or chicken on the pizza.\n\nI\'d read the poor reviews for this place and figured that it was just people used to the decent pizza in Philly.  Nope, this place is terrible even for a Domino\'s. STAY AWAY!!!! .. I ordered from here last night at 12:46am my order was delivered at 2:46am by a gentleman (term used lightly) by the name of MOHAMMAD..food was very cold of course and not edible ..I again called today to speak to a manager and was connected with MOHAMMAD who was very rude so instead of getting into a verbal confrontation I asked for the number of the corporate office which I was then directed by said "gentleman" to GOOGLE it and was told he would no longer assist me in my complaint and proceeded to hang up the phone in my ear! ..SAVE yourself the time and trouble and travel the extra few minutes distance to patronize the dominos in Plymouth Meeting on Ridge.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNPLEASANT UNPROFESSIONAL DUMP! Food isn\'t here yet and it\'s been over an hour for one small pizza. When I tried to order online, the website said there was some technical issues and it didn\'t go through. So I called and ordered. They charged my card. Then I got an email said my order was received. I was charged twice and no one at the store was a great help when I called back. I was on hold for over 15 minutes and then got hung up on. This was the worst experience I\'ve had so far with Dominos! Awful!!! We attempted to place an order online but were told we had to call because online ordering for our store was "currently unavailable". We called to place our order and were not given the opportunity to pay with a card on the phone. The person who took our call hung up before we could ask to pay with a card. After waiting an hour for literally one 12" pizza, the delivery man said he could only take cash. This forced me to put on shoes and a jacket and walk to an ATM, take the $2.50 fee for using a nonbank ATM and pay this guy in cash. What is the point of delivery if I have to put on shoes and walk outside? Also, our food is cold.... Do not bother ordering from here. Spend the extra couple bucks to order from Founded or Zesty\'s. Much better value and much better service. Straight stole my money and never delivered my food. Hate that I didn\'t first read these reviews. Never ever order from this place. Delivery was on time yeah but the driver didn\'t know how much anything was. Luckily I had the cash amount + tip ready. Handed me my food, i had to ask for my 2 liter. I get inside and discover i have no dipping sauces. If I ordered one it would be okay but 4 is unacceptable especially because I threw away 3 dollars for not receiving them. Food isn\'t here yet and it\'s been over an hour for one small pizza. When I tried to order online, the website said there was some technical issues and it didn\'t go through. So I called and ordered. They charged my card. Then I got an email said my order was received. I was charged twice and no one at the store was a great help when I called back. I was on hold for over 15 minutes and then got hung up on. This was the worst experience I\'ve had so far with Dominos! Awful!!!\nUpdate: I contacted customer support and no one has yet to get back to me almost 2 weeks later! Ridiculous!! I wish I can give this less than  one star. Took over two hours to make A SINGLE PIZZA. the online platform did say that it could take up to an hour and 20 minutes but I was not notified of any seat until I got to the store (which. Had no seating) and was told it would be an additional 35 minutes. Literally order from ANYWHERE BUT HERE Customer service is terrible. After fulfilling the order incorrectly, the manager became combative and difficult with attempting to rectify the error they made. I know it\'s Domino\'s but I\'ve always had a pleasant experience at this location! Where others have let me down, this one is reliable and trustworthy. It\'s a solid choice when you\'re craving some pizza and can\'t be bothered to make some or pop a frozen one in the oven.\n\nThe entire Domino\'s chain always offers coupons which make this a great deal. You get what you pay for for sure, but I honestly have no complaints. When I\'ve ordered for pickup, the store is always bustling and the workers seem hard at work and are always friendly. This isn\'t always the case is most fast food joints in the city. When I\'ve ordered delivery, the come super fast and the pizza is still piping hot when it gets here. Well here it comes Yelp... my first one star review. I tried to avoid the one-star for so long by going to places that have good reputations and tasty food. I should have known by the past yelp reviewers. \n\nLast night we ordered three items and all three were a big miss! I ordered a medium pizza with bacon as a topping and cooked well done. When I picked up the pizza it was hot and fresh and smelled good. When I got home and tried to break away a slice the pizza fell apart. The dough was raw and was way under-cooked in multiple spots. \n\nThe Parmesan bites were soaked...and I mean covered in a gross over whelming extra garlicky butter sauce. Not only were they covered but they were sitting in about a quarter to half a cup of it. They were beyond soggy and greasy. We tried to pull them out and pat them with paper towels but these were also NOT EDIBLE. Even after draining them 3 times on layers of paper towels they were just drenched in the butter/grease/oil garlic combo.\n\nThe last item was a dessert. I guess someone had a heavy hand with sauces that night. The cinnamon bread twists come with a side of dipping sauce and did not need whatever pool of sauce you poured into that box.. which got all over my car seat also.\n\nNOT a good experience. I am a domino\'s fan on a late Friday night but this location is not up to standards. Not sure why the reviews are so bad for this specific location every time I\'ve ordered it came on time and was what I expected. It\'s dominoes people don\'t make it more than what it is. Just shut up and eat the damn pizza! Not one employee in store was wearing a mask at all. If you can\'t wear the mask it is safe to assume they are also not washing their hands.\nWe threw the food out - grossed me out There was about 5 people working. Not ONE person was wearing a mask. The staff was also drinking alcohol.   How is this all allowed?!?!? What in the f**k. Mh pizza was also burnt. Whoever made my pizza was probably drunk from all of those tequila shots and forgot to take it out of the oven in time. Yeah I saw that half empty bottle of tequila. I am NEVER ordering from here again. Food isn\'t here yet and it\'s been over an hour for one small pizza. When I tried to order online, the website said there was some technical issues and it didn\'t go through. So I called and ordered. They charged my card. Then I got an email said my order was received. I was charged twice and no one at the store was a great help when I called back. I was on hold for over 15 minutes and then got hung up on. This was the worst experience I\'ve had so far with Dominos! Awful!!!\nUpdate: I contacted customer support and no one has yet to get back to me almost 2 weeks later! Ridiculous I wish I can give this less t one star\n\nUpdate: nothing has happened. Never was contacted by anyone and those stupid commercials that says if you have any problems with your order, we\'ll fix it. They NEVER fixed it! Done eating there! We order from this Domino\'s frequently, and they typically do a good job (sometimes off on the delivery times, but it happens).\n\nTonight, though, I had to hunt down the delivery guy once he called to tell me that he arrived. He was sitting in his car, on the other side of the street, a building away, with someone in the passenger seat (so I couldn\'t even tell it was a delivery guy working). I tipped ahead of time and when I called the store to ask if they could take the tip off, they told me no and that was that. No apologies for the unprofessionalism. So, congrats, delivery guy, here\'s your tip for me doing your job. I actually think this is one of my favorite locations to order pizza! I enjoy the online ordering and the ability to track the pizza preparation. Discounts for being rewards member. You get free pizza if they don\'t deliver carside in 2 minutes or less. Extremely disappointed with the quality of my order and the customer service of this store. Received my delivery and the pizza is totally over cooked, basically burnt. The wings are rubbery and inedible. I called the location to request a refund or new pizza that is edible and the store manager argued with me. He yelled over the phone and refused to even entertain my complaint saying that he knows the pizza is fine because he "made it". I asked to speak to someone above him and he refused. I then asked for the corporate complaint line number and he told me to Google it. I will never spend my money at Dominos again. Premium White pizza w/bacon+peppers. as far as Domino\'s goes, this is a good one\n\nIt\'d Domino\'s They are not following COVID guidelines.\nJust picked up a pizza & the gentleman making the pizza wasn\'t wear masks or gloves. Woman who collected my payment also wasn\'t wearing a mask at all. Domino\'s Pizza isn\'t that good to begin with but the delivery drivers at this place are terrible. Have they never heard of gps. Ordered from this place 3x and each time it\'s taken over an hour to get my food once they\'ve said it\'s out for delivery. The last delivery driver wanted me to come outside and walk down to the gate of my complex to get my food. Terrible place. took my baby sister to pick up her carry out order of pasta. from the moment she walked in, she was harassed the entire time. they were asking her if she had a boyfriend, how long they were together, why she wasn\'t married all while she was waiting for them to give her her food that was already prepared. once she finally paid, another dominos worker opened the door for her, asking her if she "dropped this" once she was out the door. when she turned around to see if she did indeed drop something, the worker ran inside and I watched as they all laughed at her. it was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen from workers. I will never be back here. I have ordered from this restaurant twice and BOTH times have been absolutely miserable. The first time, both of the pies I ordered were so undercooked that they were literally DOUGH. I had to cook them myself because they were completely unedible. So, let\'s get to tonight. I ordered a bbq chicken pizza and cheesy bread and it showed up an entire hour after the mobile app told me it had arrived. I called the store and they were less than helpful.. they told me that it was "on its way" which meant nothing. (this store is walking distance from my house.. yeah I\'m lazy.). \n\nSo I\'m already pissed off because my dinner is extremely late... it finally arrives and (surprise!) it\'s cold. The kicker? I ordered (and paid for) 2 marinara\'s, 2 garlic sauces and 2 blue cheeses and received ONE marinara. \n\nI called the company and here\'s how it went: 1) I waited on hold for 7+ minutes 2) I called back, asked for a manager and was hung up on 3) FINALLY received a manager who told me they\'d deliver my sauces which was so helpful for my cold, half eaten pizza. I demanded my money back.\n\nI will keep you posted if these incompetent humans actually figure out how customer service works. Two times in the past I have added a dipping cup to my order, picked it up and gotten home to find no dipping cup. Today I pick my order up and I am told my dipping cup is in the pizza box. I go outside and check my box- no dipping cup. I don\'t want to think there is some dipping cup conspiracy but frequency of this issue indicates otherwise. I have also ordered online though the app multiple times and the app tells me my order is done and I get to the store and I am told it\'s got a few more minutes. \n\nThe takeaway: always check your order to make sure you got exactly what you ordered and have all the dipping cups etc you payed for. Show up like 10 mins after the app tells you it\'s ready to avoid hanging out on their silly couch. Always, always, always order from the app and choose to pay in store. This way you can avoid having your card charged if the pizza isn\'t ready in time you can always bail. Customer service here sucks so don\'t expect much. Also employees may have an attitude so you\'ll probably have to be rude back (another reason why not to prepay). Only redeeming factor is that the food is cheap and somewhat satisfactory. \n\nAlso parking SUCKS! But at least they have it.. I guess. I think that Domino\'s makes the absolute best chicken wings in the area! Believe me, I have had them from\n about every Italian restaurant in Roxborough and nobody makes them as tasty and as tender as Domino\'s does. The really cool thing is that it\'s consistent. Every time I have ordered wings from them they are exactly the same: tender, fresh, absolutely delicious! From now on I\'m going to order them from only Domino\'s, and no place else! If I could give this Domino\'s location zero stars I would. My experience has been absolutely horrible. They first take an hour and a half to deliver a pizza with wings. Then we find out the pizza we asked for was wrong and all of the food was cold. We called the location and they hung up the first time and said that they were really busy and it would be 2 hours to get a new pizza to you. We said that we would wait for a new one still and they said they would bring it as soon as they could but we would have to give the old pizza back. After 40 more minutes we did get another pizza and once again it was wrong. Definitely do not recommend going to this Domino\'s. This is my preferred Domino\'s. I haven\'t had any issues with this location regarding the quality, accuracy, or quickness of my order. It\'s great for when I get an urge for pizza. I\'ve ordered pick-up from here a few times and each time, have had a good experience (my food is always ready on time and is hot, pick-up is quick, and the workers are usually pretty busy).\n\nPlus, you can\'t beat the coupons. Worse dominos I\'ve used by far don\'t order on football Sunday they can\'t handle volume. Food took 4 hours yup you read that right 4 hours and seemed like no one cares. At least give us some free wings or something. The dominos tracker said pizza was done 30 minutes after i ordered I called 2 hours later and the pizza wasn\'t even made yet looks like they just do it to make their time or whatever they get judged on so they lie about it.  I don\'t care how busy you are 4 hours is unacceptable. The worst delivery experience ever. I ordered 3 hours ago & no pizza. I called the store & the employee said it would be another 30 minutes. That was over an hour ago. It is now 3 am & no update. Will never be ordering dominos again. Worst customer experience & no easy way to voice concerns. Worst delivery experience possible. Took an hour for them to arrive after leaving the store. Pick a different dominos or different pizza place in general. Dominos pizza...I mean it is what it is.  Did the $6 each medium 2 topping pizza deal.  Extra pepperoni on one half which was great but the thin crust was burnt. Listen, I love burgers and I\'ve also worked in food service for a long time, including food trucks. I usually give people a pass. I know it\'s hard work. But the experience with this truck was terrible. The burgers are small and not anything special and very expensive. $12 each I believe. We waited 30 minutes for our food and it wasn\'t busy. The guy on the truck totally ignored us for quite some time. When we finally got our food the fries were cold and soggy. Not going back. \n\nLike I said I get it, it\'s rough work but not an excuse for soggy fries and a burger that looked like it was stepped on. I wish I could give it zero stars. The absolute worst burger and rip off mania prices you could ask for. I get it you have to charge a premium for being in the "Spruce Street Harbor" area for the summer nights in Philly but at least produce a half-way decent burger. The ordering is just so disorganized and the wait is literally 25-30 mins for a burger I could make on my hot plate and the worst fries. I paid about $20.00 for a smash burger that had zero flavor and basically looked like a smashed meatball on a Walmart potato roll. To add to that, the fries are literally tossed in oil with no regard for humanity, they become encrusted with tiny bits of over fried oil and there was also some mystery pieces of meat stuck in the French Fry oil. They also charge $3.00 for bottled soda which was the only thing of quality because it was factory sealed. Anyhow this place is awful and disgusting and I would never spend another dime at this rip off establishment. I hate writing bad reviews but people need to be told the truth. I had high expectations given Village Whiskey\'s reputation but this was terrible - to say the least. The bun was not fresh, not toasted. It was cold. I asked for the veggie black bean burger and got some Boca veggies burger which was edible at best. Please don\'t eat here! I usually check reviews, but went on an impulse upon finding El Nica was closed. The reviews are true. Since it was busy, the burger took awhile, only to have the fries forgotten. Took another 20 minutes and refund request to finally get an order. Sat down to the lukewarm burger to find the bun was burnt in the bottom and half the patty was missing.\n\nCulminated with the meh service, this is why Garces\' empire fell. Will not return. Every. Single. Time. I go to a Village Burger in a pop up like SSHP, Winterfest, Franklin Square, etc, it takes FOREVER and the workers are so rude. I\'m here at Winterfest and have been waiting for my burger for 30 minutes. Totally unacceptable. Got the fries here thinking thinking they must be great, because after all it\'s a burger joint.\n\nThe fries claimed to be seasoned in some house special seasoning, but if they were I couldn\'t tell. Or maybe the house seasoning is imaginary. It was a basket of soggy fries, that felt like they were frozen.\n\nPaid extra for the cheese sauce, which I thought would come on the side like at Chickie and Pete\'s. Instead the fries were doused in some nacho cheese/cheez wiz tasting goop, so much that I had to eat with a fork.\n\nIf I was Jose Garces, I would be embarrassed to put my name on such an abomination. Seriously, how do you mess up FRIES?\n\nWaste of money, time, and calories. Very slow on burgers. Apparently they were frozen so it\'s taking longer. Would have liked to know before ordering.  This better be the best darn burger ever or I may need to take away the one star.\n\nOkay, had the burger. Very very below par. Tasted freezer burnt. Almost like a tops frozen patty. Not an $11 burger. It\'s Saturday night in the middle of the summer. How do you run out of thawed burgers. Seriously! Got impossible burger at spruce st harbor park. Patty looks and tastes burnt. Never going back. Was walking around Penn\'s Landing with a friend and he wanted to grab a snack... you\'d think that a not busy food stand would be relatively quick, but you\'d think wrong. All in all a simple hot dog, when the place was not even busy, took a whopping twenty two minutes to prepare. If this is the wait time on a slow weekday, I can only imagine how terrible this place is when it is busy on the weekend.\n\nAlso, if you\'d think that the chicken waffle cone sounds delicious, just pass. It doesn\'t look good at all when you finally get it. There is nothing good about this place. The veggie burger was tasteless salty and fell apart. The service was her Renda\'s. Even though they offered us french fries, they will not see us again. Got the vegan impossible burger and fries. The impossible burger was delicious, as expected (I\'ve heard nothing but great things about it since it\'s come out). The fries were covered in old bay spice though, which personally I don\'t like so I didn\'t really eat them. In all though it was absurdly overpriced, like most things at Spruce harbor park. Tried the imposible burger for the first time which good, well charred on both sides and great bun. Would like to see more flavor with the burger. Great friendly staff. Somehow burgers eaten from a truck taste better-- especially this time of year, when parks season is officially kicking off. Welcome back 80+ degree weather.\n\nLast week, a group of us went to Spruce Street Harbor Park on a Friday evening. I was in the mood for some truck (yummy) burger, so I stood in line for few minutes, and ordered (with zero expectations,) the Village burger & fries combo ($12.00.) Followed by more than 20 minutes to get my unremarkable burger. It wasn\'t bad, but not warranted a second visit.\n\nTwo and Half Yelps. Pack your food before going to the park. The wait to order was 30 minutes and there was 6-8 people ahead of us. A burger a chicken sandwich and two hot dogs $39 that is insane. Then it was 45 minutes for that order to come out. The burger looked like a frozen cheap burger my chicken was overdone and the rolls for everything were cheap. Never again. I was surprised by the bad reviews. I love impossible burger and the two dollar cheddar is worth it because it\'s really good cheese. My friend had the chicken in waffle cone and liked it. It is expensive but spruce street harbor park has expensive food only. The lady working the register was pissed and obviously didn\'t wanna deal with any customers, and it was $26 for a chicken sandwich and burger that were mediocrely slapped together. Rarely, and I mean rarely do I ever make a review about a "fast food restaurant". But this is needed to heed warning to my fellow Yelpers. This is the second time I\'ve been to this KFC and the last time I attempt to give them business. One the first occasion they told me my meal would take about 20 mins to complete and all I ordered was a 8 piece with 2 sides? No courtesy offered no alternatives asked. But today tops the cake, I ordered 2 Famous Bowls, after them telling me their brand new loaded bowl which is the main reason I came they didn\'t have, so I settled for normal bowls. But was told they would take about 15 mins which kinda took me by HUGE surprise. And in the process of me thinking wether to wait or not the gentleman behind the mic says "well is you waiting or not??" I just pulled off, never will be back. Sharaya the cashier I had tonight was excellent. Great personality, pleasant, and patient. I can\'t always say that at this location, but tonight that was the case. Other than the 19 minute wait for the grilled chicken (which can happen) I was pleased with my visit tonight. I have 2 KFC\'s near me, and I definitely prefer this one to the one on Champlost (the worst). I only go to that location because there\'s a Taco Bell attached and it\'s not one at this location. Slow service. EXTREMELY slow. I\'ve seen 90 year olds work faster with a walker and a new hip replacement. This is the absolute worst KFC I have ever been to. The customer service is horrible. I don\'t think it\'s the employees, I think it\'s management. The fact that it takes almost 20 min to order and receive 2 chicken Little\'s is ridiculous. There was only one person in front of me in line. This is not fast food This is the absolute worst KFC I have ever been to. The customer service is horrible. I don\'t think it\'s the employees, I think it\'s management. The fact that it takes almost 20 min to order and receive 2 chicken Little\'s is ridiculous. There was only one person in front of me in line. This is not fast food I always get the same order famous bowl with chicken on the side because it sucks up my gravy and makes chicken soggy once again a new one I went to said I can\'t get it on the side they don\'t have a container?? Ridiculous put it in what the others do a mashed potatoes container!!! I haven\'t had KFC in quite some time, and tonight I was reminded why. The Adams Avenue location (workers AND food) is the absolute WORST!! You\'d think they would put just a tad more effort into the quality of their food (and attitudes), since after all it IS the public helping to keep them afloat during this pandemic. The posted pictures tells the story. Old, and dried out hot wings, and coleslaw which had a sour taste to it. Sadly, I was stuck with this nastiness because no one is able to return anything during this time, but lesson learned. Into the trash it went...NEVER again.\n\n (*Only 1 star given because it was required to post this review. Otherwise...) I\'m one of those people who will complain and need a resolution if I\'m right, and I\'m one of those people who give praise when needed.  I had a problem with the KFC at 161 W Chelten Ave and was trying to get the store number so that I could call the General Manager and lodge a formal complaint.  I called this 716 Adams Ave location to see if they knew the store number and the Ass. Manager, Terrell answered and was very sorry for my situation and wanted to rectify the problem because he did not want to lose me as a KFC customer. He offered to replace my two $5.00 fill up boxes.  When I arrived he and his manager Vernita took good care of me and she (Vernita) looked up the store number for me.  They went above and beyond.  Thank you to the both of you.. This is the absolute worst KFC I have ever been to. The customer service is horrible. I don\'t think it\'s the employees, I think it\'s management. The fact that it takes almost 20 min to order and receive 2 chicken Little\'s is ridiculous. There was only one person in front of me in line. This is not fast food. Very rude and attitude and cashier does not feel like taking your order and ordered the wrong thing and does not feel like giving you a refund without having an attitude and refusing to do an x-ray for something else that you do not want Sometimes they forget to pack your entire order. \n\nThey rarely have dark meat :/\n\nSo, I guess it depends what you need and what service you\'re looking for at the KFC. \n\nGoodluck. Check your orders! Since this KFC is in my neighborhood, once in a while I\'ll stop it. Over time I\'ve realized, this KFC is a hit & miss. You have some good days & you have some really bad days, however the good days are far & in between. They have a tendency not to pack your order right, or maybe give you the wrong item. The customer service could be so much better, and there\'s been times I\'ve walked in & the dining room area need a good cleaning (That\'s when I walked back out). They have bulletproof windows. Yikes! Aside from that, I love KFC! The chicken thighs are so juicy! Just left here. Had a horrible experience.  The guy who rung up my order had to be new. He knew nothing about the food at all. He kept sayinvd, i dont know. well can you ask somebody??? I ordered a chicken pot pie and was told 20 min. By that time i had 4 cars in front of me. I get to the window, pay for my order and realize i wasnt charged for the pot pie. so i ask and he says oh we can put in orders with more than a 5 min wait. Well why didnt you say that. I ask how long left on the pot pies he says 13 min. I wait a little go get back in line. get the mic at the drive thru and ordered my pot pie. He says 20 min. I said you just told me 13 min 15 min ago. Ask ti speak to a manager. by this time there are 5 cars in front of me. I get to the window. the allege manager comes and i explain to her what occured she like yea he never put it on. No apologies or an. So I ask how long and she says 20 Min. How so after all this time no one never put it on. done with this location.  This is closest to my house but I will drive to baltimore ave just to get better service and better food quality. They are the worst my back yard shares a fence to this shit hole I\'ve been living behind it for 15 years it was good about 13 years ago you don\'t see the same faces for more than a month or two the chicken skin is rubbery it\'s greasy falls off the thing just horrible managers arguing with workers and customers my advice don\'t I can\'t speak about all the KFC\'s but this one is the worst went there Sunday night and was greeted by the dirtiest cashier I have ever seen ! He must have used his apron to wipe the floor , he was so busy looking at the girls coming in he didn\'t notice I was trying to pay for my order! They never have certain chicken parts and forget about getting more than 5 hot wings . I wrote to the company and am waiting for some kind of response! Someone needs to check this place out, there is definitely something wrong with management in this location This is as others said, the worst KFC in there area, not so much as the food, but its the human attitudes by some of the cashiers, which is all the time there, example, recently I clearly said 2 piece chicken order thru the drive thru speaker the attitude cashier said anything else (basically confirming she understood what i said), i said no, when i got to the window & checked order it had only 1 piece chicken in it, when i said i ordered 2 piece the nasty attitude, 17 year old cashier said no u didnt and i said i did (& i had witness in car with me), I asked the cashier that should had just been glad she had a job at $2.75 per hour, if i can get another piece of chicken, she said no and that i would will have to go around thru drive thru again (there was no customers in drive thru at time & i could see there was no customers at counter in store),I told her nevermind forget it, knowing that my complaints at this location is just beginning moving up ladder. I have had bad experience here before, from store closing but outside signs on menu board fully lighted, then they would watch u on camera sitting there for several mins then someone would say oh we are closed, u look at your watch that says 7pm, but store hours for example say they close at 9pm. Then multiple times when they said there was no chicken here at the chicken store, smh.\n\nI use to be a manager at a fast food store very long time ago, but I do believe the problem here is not just the 17 or 19 year old cashiers, but its the managers as well for allowing their employee\'s to get away with such a rude poor attitude with their customers, as its the customers that keeps the place open and keep the cashiers their $2.75 per hour jobs. Not mention sometime i suspect food is dirty with bacteria causing stomach problems, i will never go to this place again This is the slowest drive thru in America. Just say no, it took over 30 minutes with hardly anybody in line. I will never come here again, you would do better cooking it yourself it quicker and it will be fresh. I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs platter and it was so bland that it reminded me of hospital food. Sauce was brown, not red. Meatballs were frozen style. Just very bad for the price. So disappointing. In the interest of full disclosure, I WILL say that my turkey sandwich was pretty tasty. The fries were just okay, as some were burnt, and I think they had freshly washed the lettuce, as my sandwich roll was soggy in spots, and had a bit of a drip when I held it. Still, tasty and tasted very fresh. BUT, bring cash, or just avoid this place. Im kinda upset with how my lunch scenario went. My lunch special came out to 8.65 and I only had $8 in cash. So, like everywhere these days, there was a $10 minimum for credit card purchases. (FYI, that practice is illegal if a place accepts any card more than AmEx....), so I bought a piece of cake that I didn\'t want, to meet the minimum. My new total; $13. Huh? The freaking slice of cake was 3.50, there was a ADDITIONAL 75 cent charge for using the card, and THEN they rounded up from my total of 12.90 to $13. THEN, and this is the kicker, my special came with a can of soda, which they didn\'t have, so they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL dollar for a 16 oz substitute. I had already paid at that point, so I\'m assuming it was the only reason they didn\'t make a big stink about it. I PROMISE that unless I have cash, I will NEVER eat at Napolis again. Thus guy offered me a job at 5.50$ an hour like i m a fugitive and it\'s 1964 and he said I want to see yr face now come here only for few minutes to remember the face with the number like he will send a hit out if I alert" the world about it..he needs a slap that ain\'t even inuff for gas to get to him not to mention all my qualifications witch are way over qualified my background might not be the best but if ima go back to slave work specially a cash job best believe u better pay me worth it...not t mention I won\'t be getting taxes back not that I ever really did regardless but paying into yr social security helps...some what that\'s a insult and a half someone has to tell this guy it\'s 2017 never in my life I heard of that low a salary geez ...sucks the three days four hours is OK with me but from a 14.50$ an hour job to 5.50$ an hr ain\'t happening I\'ll stay home and ride the sofa One star because a half a star option is unavailable.  I ordered a special of 2 large pies for $14.95. It arrived promptly after 30 minutes. When the delivery driver arrived I was surprised to see that the total jumped to $18.50 with no additional toppings.  When I went to open the box I immediately knew from looking at the crust that this establishment uses cheap frozen dough. The cheese and sauce were lacking in flavor. The pizza was disgusting to say the least. Beware of these lackluster pizza impostors. Cheese steaks are good after me & my husband ordered from every pizzeria possible in this neighborhood. Im still discovering more but so far theyre cheese steaks are the best Their delivery is a lil bit slow. The pizza is delicious with the right amount of grease that slides off the pizza. Great Philly Pizza! YUM! I have a problem with multiple pizzeria having my debit card info so I\'ve always stuck with Eds pizza..\n\nKids enjoyed their pizza and I enjoyed my buffalo wings . \n\nDelivery usually takes 30-45mins The white pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese were very delicious, but too much greasy. I love the white pizza better than other pizzas. Order from here tonight.  Took a 1hr 1/2 to get my order then didn"t send my complete order. Their was hair  on my pizza and my meatball sandwich only had 2 meatballs on that long roll. Food usually is good , but tonight I was unhappy with the service. For a $45.00 order tall have to do better!!! I ordered a pizza and it took almost 3 hours for them to deliver it. The service was horrible. They claimed they were at the wrong address, but someone always call when they\'re outside. I will never order from Ed\'s again. When I finally got my order, the pizza was nasty! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! Horrible, ordered off grub hub ans specifically put " no red sauce"  on my steak Stromboli , once the Stromboli arrives it has red sauce on it, so i called the girl hung up on me, i called back kept me on hold then once she picked up told me they would send another one out but i need to send the other one back, what kind of place wants food back from someones home who knows what they could have done with it, what are you gonna do with it sell it to another customer??  i told them cancel the order i didn\'t trust what they would do to my food i will never ever order anything from them again. Horrible!!!! I waited two hours for my food to be delivered. Fries were soggy and chicken fingers weren\'t crispy.\nI was very disappointed. They charged me .75 for ketchup on the side,  that I never got...smh\nI grew up eating Ed\'s on Germantown,  abs I hope the food is still good Horrible customer services. Order through Grubhub the "business" called me back to tell me a few things  in my order are not available they\'re gonna charge we for the remaining items and she just hung up. Called back and told them to cancel the whole order she told me "don\'t call back here again" how they\'re still in business is beyond me. I simply ordered some pizza from this place for them to cancel my order because i missed their call when they called me back! First of all their customer service is TRASH never in my life have ive been treated so poorly over the phone. I called them back to change my order and tell them i wanted to pick the order up. The girl who picked up the phone spoke down to me when i told her i was confused as to why she was retaking my order. I will never be ordering from this place again. I took a gamble going here because my sister recommended it to me. But customer service is worth more to me than your trash ass pizza. Never again. Do not eat here !!!! Waited Almost two hours for a grilled chicken salad... they forgot my order and would have changed me and not made it if i didnt call to complain about how long they took ... the girl who answers the phone is clueless to the menu and prices then i asked for somthing for my troubles and the service and she told me age didn\'t kno how its like train ur employees I came in ordered, a customer ordered the same behind me. She got her food first and I watched at they added more food to the oven and I had to wait. The charge for using a credit card is ridiculous as the wait. The was my second negative experience ... I won\'t be back.... The pizza is really good though... js Gross and poor service. Got my order wrong and if you move the cheese away on the pizza there\'s no sauce underneath wth I order from Ed\'s all the time. The service has never been questionable. They are polite on phone while taking your order. You can order online, they will email u with updates on your food and the delivery status. Delivery is usually fast and on time. And of course the food is delicious....especially their pizza. OMG! If I could give a minus 100 stars, I would!!! This place is the absolute worst EVER! If you get my order WRONG twice, something is ridiculously wrong. If you cannot read or write, you should not (I Repeat) NOT be able take the phone orders. I had to wait almost THREE hours for my ONE pizza! WTF? How is this place still in business? Maybe L & I and the Dept of health need to pay them a visit.... Or somebody, because I have never had such horrible service from anywhere EVER! A thousand thumbs down, ya\'ll suck!!!!!!!! Needs New competent management!!! The worst over the phone customer service I\'ve ever experienced in my 37yrs of life. Manager stood by and allowed the cashier to get extremely nasty. The food was NOT prepared the way requested and i was told they can NOT remake the food nor offer any type of refund and I have to deal with it..CANCELED (.)! Id give this place zero stars if I could. I waited almost two hours for my order of two milkshakes. Had someone from the place call me and tell me my order was going to be delivered last because I was the farthest from them and then when the delivery driver arrives, he practically runs away from me after giving me the milkshakes. He ran so fast I couldn\'t even say anything about the milkshake bag leaking and spilling all over my front porch. My family ordered $ 123.00 worth of food , first off they demanded we pay with a card although we have ordered from this establishment plenty of times and paid with cash , they never suggested any specials and didn\'t offer a 2 liter , we had to actually buy one although we spent that much money . We ordered 4 large pizzas, wings, fries  and once we got the food they sent a menu that\'s when we saw they had 2 large pizzas that came with a 2 liter . I called to inquire about why a 2 liter didn\'t come with the food or any specials were offered ( which is good customer service) the young lady asked if I wanted to speak with a manager I said yes she put me on hold next thing I herd a males  voice advising he would like to place a order , (she merged the calls together ) I called back to advise I was on hold for a manager this young lady said oh your the one holding about a soda and busted out laughing then passed the phone to another young lady who said your on hold for a manger I said yes she laughed and passed it to another young lady who then ask was I serious and hung up. I will never order from this elementary school again and also advised my neighbors if there behavior . This was very poor customer service especially for the $ we spent . Oh also they didn\'t even send us any plates, napkins . I called and ordered food got a total and never got my food delivered or a phone call with a cancellation extremely unprofessional! The cashier was having a completely different conversation while taking my order telling someone their food smelled so good . I am so mad my food never came !!!!! the worst pizza...they mess up your order...produce disgusting food and have lots of sass when you complain...i didnt want my money back...i wanted my pizza made correctly...don\'t waste your money Good Buffalo sauce, however I was charged for all flat wings but was given really huge drumsticks which I couldn\'t eat, also my fries were not done. Horrible !!!!!! I\'ve been a consistent customer of this place until today ! Today I ordered and my order took almost 2 hours to get to me and when received the chicken wing sauce was spilled all in the bag and the chicken was dry and tossed all around the bag. My pizza was cold and the cheese was stiff and when I called the restaurant it took them forever to find my order and the woman said they could send me out a new order I said okay. The woman called me back and asked if there was any food missing and I said 2 slices were missing because my husband warmed it up and  ate it before I could get through to the pizzeria . The woman then continued to say how they won\'t be able to fix my order because the slices were missing like wtf I waited so long for my food to look and be presented disgustingly and they couldn\'t even accommodate a loyal customer . I WILL NO LONGER BW ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SHIT and I\'m still dissatisfied!!!! The consistency of their food is what I have the most issues with.  The last order was the best so far.  We shared with a few neighbors who have lived locally for years and they were impressed.  The lady who took the order by phone was really sweet and didn\'t rush us. No problems with delivery. \n\nPrevious orders have come out bland and/or under cooked.  I hope this last time is not the best time, but the expectation from here on out.  We don\'t order anything crazy, just pizza and wings every time. I ordered a buffalo pizza, the pizza had little amount of chicken on It.\nThe pizza was dry and the sauce was just ok.\nI wouldn\'t buy from ed again Loved the outdoor patio - cosy and private and decked out with bright garden furniture. However, that\'s pretty much the best part of it and the only reason it\'s getting 3 stars and not 2. I was excited to try out this place which is right by the Piazza at Schmidt\'s but rather disappointed.\n\nThe menu was limited and there was definitely some false advertising on the part of the restaurant because the website indicates "all you can drink bloody marys and mimosas for $20 + 1 entree" but when we arrived the waitress told us $25. \n\nThe food was "meh". I was unimpressed by the turkey bacon benedict I ordered, and the egg white omelette and salmon benedict the others ordered were all quite bland. Not worth a drive up to this place if I can make a better brunch myself! If I do head out here again, I\'d probably try the other outdoor brunch places nearby instead. A girlfriend of mine had a Groupon type thing and invited me to try this place. Our waitress was very sweet but that is about all the compliment I can muster. The food was sub par (pizza, tempura asparagus, fries)and I don\'t think there was a drop of alcohol in my drink. We were the only people in the place when we arrived and it took about 10 minutes to get our first drink. The outdoor area has potential but I probably won\'t go back...no reason to with so many other options in no-libs. The best I could do was give this place 3 stars. I really wanted to LOVE it.\nMy husband and I took the kids for dinner...we started out wanting to go to PYT (we could sit outside and enjoy the weather and the kids could be crazy and loud and mix in with the music) We passed by Chenango and saw there was outside seating and had just talked about this place.\nI sent my husband inside first to see if our kids could come in and eat. They were more than happy to have us as there was a total of 2 other tables in the whole place.(the pool looked pretty dead too) We sat outside (I loved the feel...layed back and casual). Our waiter happily came over to greet us and tell us about the happy hour specials (score!). My husband and I ordered the house sangria and hummus for the ap.\nTen minutes later our waiter came over and said they were out of sangria mix (really there is a mix...and there were only 5 other people in this place at 6pm) and asked if we would like something else. So we chose something else...whatever I just wanted a drink and food.\nOur drinks finally arrived another 10 minutes later and we put in our food order (a pizza for the kids and a burger and crabcake sandwich).\nAfter about another 30 minutes our dinner arrived. I was kind of shocked as my hummus ap was no where to be found!\nI started to cut my burger in half and noticed the thin patty was already cut into two pieces (really you couldn\'t temp a thin beef  patty without cutting it) but on a large bun (too much bread).\nIt was a good burger...I mean not PYT but still good...I ate the whole thing.\nThe kids also enjoyed their pizza (how can 5 year olds not enjoy pizza). As for the crabcake sandwich I will not review it as I did not taste it...I do however know my husband sent it back and ordered the Burger instead and a side of fingerling potato salad.\nThe hummus finally arrived after I finished my burger....I ate it as I was still hungry. It was good and the pits is pizza dough(great flavor) the only thing I didn\'t "like" ablut the hummus is they put the roasted peppars, olives and feta chese on top of the hummus instead of on the side(had I known this was how it came I wuld have said no olives).\nMy husbands burger came in record time and undercooked but her ate it anyway (he was starving and we had beeb there too long) and the fingerling potato salad was dry and could have used more seasoning.\nAs we were trying to finish everything the chef came out of the kitchen and appologized (as had the waiter already appologized) and said he had just made some fresh desserts and was sending them to our table.\nLet me tell you...these desserts saved Chenango from 2 stars! Where did these desserts come from.....the chef has got to be trained in desserts!\nThe lemon sorbet with raspberries was amazing....he also had 2 different frozen deserts one chocolate and one i can\'t remember but it was fantastic.\nI want Chenango to succeed but the management team needs to train the waitstaff better(very nice but a little lost) and the kitchen needs to get better quality food out faster. The overall design with the outdoor seating is great--truly lovely.  But everything else is below average.  Food was as basic as you an get and the drinks are watered down and over priced.  We were there at 9pm on a Saturday and we were the only ones there.  In fact, they only had one person working there as the host/waiter/bartender.  That should tell you something... if this place was doing well wouldn\'t they have more people on hand for a prime time slot like this?  By the time we left two more parties had shown up (with two people to each party).  Overall I was just disappointed.  I want this place to do well, but right now, I have no idea what they are doing. "Meh" indeed.  \n\nI bought a Philly Dealyo to this place because I heard they had a cute outdoor area (the fall weather decided to set in the night we went, so we sat inside).  We waited for ten minutes until someone took our drink order.  Now at a Stephen Starr place this would be no big deal, but I would like to point out that this place was empty and we were sitting at the bar...where no one else was sitting.  Finally, I ordered the white peach margarita.  The bartender, who looked like the epitome of a "gorilla juicehead" (ask Snooki, if you don\'t know what I\'m talking about) told me that they weren\'t making any frozen drinks because they didn\'t have a blender.  Ok, but why is it on the menu then?  I settled for a raspberry mojito, which was made with fresh raspberries and was quite good.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the pulled pork sliders and my husband got the burger.  We decided to share a side of the sweet corn succotash.  Good thing we got the side, because that was the only good dish--and it was good!  However, the sliders had a strange flavor and I had to spit out two inedible chucks of cartilage.  My husband\'s burger was better--nothing special though.  And the fries that it came with were over-salted.  \n\nThe decor is sub-par.  It kind of looks like a Southwestern inspired warehouse...except that re-runs of Seinfeld are blaring in the background.  Weird.  It\'s also difficult to find, as it\'s diagonal from the Piazza, inside of the Arrow Swim Club.  I think it\'s very unlikely that this place will survive for much longer. Wasn\'t impressed with the fancy mixed drinks. Food was sub par.  Atmosphere for beer and drinks in the summer though is relaxing and fun! Terrible restaurant associated with a terrible swim club. People will go there regardless of the review because it attracts a scene but the arrow swim club hides the reality of what people think about them by deleting honest posts by members from their social media pages and then blocking them from posting again. The staff are rude and poorly trained. The management treats members like dirt and they charge you for things you didn\'t authorize like $1000 on my credit card and when I called to ask what the charge was for the lady said she didn\'t know. How can you not know why you charged someone $1000? We aren\'t talking about $20 we are talking about $1000!!!!  This leads me to believe the billing department is either uneducated and or incompetent. Mind you I am a paid member and have personally paid for two memberships myself. I strongly suggest you skip this establishment when you visit nolibs. On top of all this they didn\'t ever remember who I was even though I went there about 5 times a week with my girlfriend who was also a member when they opened. Terrible management terrible service overpriced gimmickry. Sadly I doubt this review will bring about the accountability the establishment lacks. Instead of blocking unhappy members, they could have easily tried to make up for their mistakes but I guess that is a pretty high expectation for such a poorly run establishment Went for brunch over the summer and did not have the best time.  We were given the wrong price for all you can drink, our server didnt advise us on the difference between members and non members.  Which was odd, b/c after hearing we werent members early on our service slowed down considerably in comparison to other tables.  As it was pretty empty, the slow service seemed particularly purposeful.  Prob wouldnt go back. Appetizer  Came with dinner WTH! Get it together..... Steak is barely warm..... Now I\'m gonna get pissy...\nThey did Not have the Lancaster chicken avail. or Salmon or Oysters. So we were left with few choices. Wait staff slow & didn\'t ck in with us. Hey! There were only 2 tables max at one time. For the upscale pricing, the service and food should have been much better. If they don\'t do better soon, they won\'t make it. was in a brunch mood and ended up here to try the unlimited mimosas and blood marys which was advertised as $20 and ended up being $25.  the bloody mary (i\'m not really a fan, but tried it anyway) was very peppery and not to my liking, however it did give me a slight buzz. the mimosas were much better.\n\ni ordered the smoked salmon benedict which was accompanied by 6 to 7 pieces of potatoes...guys, you don\'t get much of a serving here! my bf had the margherita pizza which was ok, nothing special.\n\nwe ate at the patio. it was the only nice thing about the brunch. the weather was lovely and we stayed a bit after brunch to just chill. they have a bunch of seats and mini-beds to hang around at. \n\nthis place would probably be good for happy hour outdoors and late-nights. idk if i\'d go back....maybe if they have a good happy hour or something This is the worst McDonald\'s I have ever been too. Waited 25 minutes for food and customer service was horrendous! Ordered coffee that was flavored, they took the order and money with no problem, then as we were getting our order, we got regular coffee instead of what we orders because the machine was broken and we were not told. \nDo not come here!!! There are other McDonald\'s close by that are way better! In all the years that we\'ve attended this location, their shake machine has NEVER worked. Over the years, we\'ve been ripped off so many times that I assure you, I\'m not laughing. Tonight, they tell us "go to the first window" We go to the 1st window and wait for about 10 minutes before they bother to tell us they closed that window and to go to the second window. Fast food? Not exactly. Then they don\'t give us our burger. Double Quarter Pounder with cheese. You better believe we paid for that sandwich. I bet it\'s tasty too, you\'ll have to ask whoever is eating it, because it isn\'t my husband. This location is a joke in our neighborhood. Everyone around here knows that you get ripped off, but if you\'re in a hurry, and forget to look in the bag before you get home... sucks to be you and I\'m tired of it. Omg! Close this place! They charged me for a #15 and kids meal and acted like I didn\'t order anything! Don\'t ask for a manager because they won\'t help. Just awful!! The dirtiest one ever. Don\'t order after midnight. I\'m an Uber driver and I always wait atleast 10+ minutes for the order to be ready. They don\'t staff enough people for 3rd shift. I\'m currently waiting in line behind 5 or 6 cars, and nobody is moving at all. This is bad I waited for 15 min in the drive thru just to pull around and have to scream "hello" To the lady who was not doing her job with her ear piece in. \nShe was #1 picking her nose, looks like she was on something, and didn\'t remember anything we said. We had to repeat it MULTIPLE times to her.\nMusic was BLASTING the lady could barely hear us.\nAnd 2 of the coworkers who were I guess making the food didn\'t have their mask on. \nNOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL THIS PLACE SUCKS SORRY. \nMy food was just thrown in the bag. \nMy chicken was burnt too. This McDonald\'s might be the WORST one I\'ve ever ordered from. Me and my friends did UberEats and received cold, incorrect food that was old and stale. Not to mention it took over 2 hours despite being 5 minutes away. Save your money and go to another McDonald\'s. Food is horrible service is horrible. I will never get food from this sloppy run McDonald\'s again. Oh one more thing. Your employees are soooooo rude Absolutely terrible. This place deserves zero stars. My boyfriend and I just got home from vacation around 8:10 pm and decided to stop here for a late dinner. The drive thru and restaurant were dead so we thought it would be quick. Boy, were we wrong. To start with, the one car ahead of us was taking forever with ordering - we thought maybe it was the customers fault, but when it was finally our turn to order, the woman taking the order had quite a difficult time trying to put our order in and kept mishearing us. Not a big deal, but it made the process even slower. Now for the most aggravating part. We pull up to the window to pick up the food, and the woman doesn\'t acknowledge us, and we were sitting there for 5 minutes while she was chatting away with coworkers. My boyfriend started to get aggravated, and he motions to her to open the window and asks her what she is doing. She tells us that she is not on the fryer and not making the food, and her job is to just hand out the food. She had a major attitude with us. After this exchange, she eventually handed us the bag of food and didn\'t say a word. Then she turns back to her coworkers to complain about us. At this point she still has not handed us our two sodas and a shamrock shake that we paid for. So again we wait there another 3 minutes and have to get her attention. Another woman was there who we thought was a manager and didn\'t seem to be too apologetic to us. We had to tell this other woman we still have not received our drinks, and we pointed out they were sitting there right behind her. The service we received at this location was terrible. When we got home, my boyfriend called the store and spoke to a manager. Surprise surprise, the manager told us that this is the second complaint he\'s received from the employee in question and that he had "severely reprimanded" her. He offered to make this up to us, but my boyfriend declined as we don\'t want to give them any more business & this experience left a bad taste in our mouths. Oh and to top it all off, they gave me a coke instead of the Diet Coke I ordered so that had to be thrown down the drain. They need to hire employees that know how to speak to and treat customers. This was unacceptable. What an unpleasant experience @ 8901 Frankford Ave McDonald\'s in PHL on 9/13/2021. As a worker who is always on the road almost daily I stop at any nearby McDonald\'s to make a purchase and use the restroom before a work appointment. Went out of my way to get to this location. Upon arrival at 10 AM or so, doors locked. Delivery truck is blocking most of the drive-in line so that made using the app too difficult and dangerous while figuring out what that was all about. Went to the drive-in line & ordered a large soda. Came to $1.73. I gave them $5.00. I received only $3.25 in return instead of $3.27 with no receipt for my travel expenses. I asked about my 2 cents shorted me more about principal than the actual 2 cents. I was informed by person that was dressed like a manger that they are running out of change. (At 10 AM?) In that case they should give me $3.30 in return as NOT HAVING ENOUGH CHANGE IS YOUR PROBLEM as the seller, not my problem as the buyer. What a customer mess this place is. This was the worst McDonald\'s experience. We had an early morning work shift so we stopped to get some breakfast. As soon as we rolled up to the drive thru, she said wait a minute. That isn\'t the issue. She then asked if we were ready after 5 minutes. Still we kept out cool. We told her our order for 2 breakfast combos. She said "last window". We roll up and after 2 minutes, she comes to the window and says "$10.xx". My friend pulls out his card and she says "cash only."  We asked "what?! McDonald\'s is cash only?" She says "yeah". We asked why and she closed the window. Gave us the hand and walked away and started mopping. The customer service here was unbelievably rude and I cannot believe that she said cash only. Very shady. I love this place. I go everyday for the same thing i usually don\'t go in any more due to me being lazy but they have great customer service the inside is usually clean or your will see young people walking around and cleaning it, and when you walk in you get greeted I, Hoagie lage, had waited an hour to order my food then 40 minutes to receive it this is horrendous and they need to fix this. This should be illegal. Stopped here for breakfast with my mom. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. We both got egg McMuffins with hash browns and enjoyed our meals. They have a small outdoor seating area which is nice. The bathroom stalls are tight but clean. Horrible service.  I waited at the point of purchase for over 5 minutes until a manager realized that there was no one working the register.  Now I am sitting at a table and it\'s been over 10 minutes and have not received my side salad and burger yet. Lazy staff, don\'t answer the phone, they forget parts of your orders so watch out ! Just go to a different McDonald\'s Under New Manager and boy does it show. The food is a million times better. The service is drastically improved. Check it out. I was looking through menus. So I figure I give this place a try. And I\'m glad I did. The pizza was really good. Definitely worth a try. The cheese steak was ok. The bread was not fresh. Nothing great about this place. Hit up one of the other 100 pizza places on the ave. The food is mediocre at best. They have awesome pizza, cool owner, and people... Really there food is good, but the pizza reminds me of boardwalk pizza... I live right across the street so i order there alot, so I will get more mistakes they make, but they always make up for it. I love this place! We normally order from my job and the lunch specials are affordable and quite filling. The chicken quesadillas are always fresh and delicious. Salads are awesome as well. This place is so good, I come here on my days off!! Ordered delivery through GrubHub for lunch for some friends. Extra large pizza, twelve buffalo wings and a 2 liter. I liked it. My buddies likes it.(Hunger helps). It was the middle of the afternoon. It came pretty quickly. Cool. Keeps putting menus in my door. Decide tonight I\'ll try em. Call up say they don\'t deliver here. Then don\'t litter my door with your damn menus you pricks. Much better in the past year... doing a great job. The make great food, and less mistakes. Stopped in for a plain gyro, just pita and meat.  I say this over and over and over just to make sure I get the right thing.  The chef hands another chef my gyro meat and he dumps it on a pizza, realizes what he\'s done, and seems to berate the other chef for his own mistake, I now wait another 5 - 10 mins and they provide me with my gyro, covered in onions, tomatoes, and sauce. I explain they got my order wrong and the chef that earlier berated the other chef has the gaul to tell me that\'s how it comes despite my specific ordering. I leave the gyro on the counter, wish him a good day and leave.  I would rather drop 20$ on the ground then ever even attempt to eat here again. Okay the pizza is genuinely some of the best pizza.... My kids love the quesadillas, my fav is the chicken plenty of meat and cheese huge and the price is awesome... Became a weekly regimen The food is pretty good they\'ve definitely stepped up their game in the last year or two.. I recommend the buffalo wings there fabulous ordered ziti, delivered over 1 hour late. food was cold. ziti was over cooked and like soup while mozzarella on top was burned. just disgusting. the plain Salad I ordered obviously had olives and what just taken off of it rather than taking the time to just make a new one!! It tasted so bad. the ziti noodles were all broken up in a watered down sauce. my order was supposed to come with a bread and I confirmed that with them yet it wasn\'t delivered. when I called about my order to complain I was just put off and eventually hung up on. if I tried to call it would go straight to their inbox so they saw my number and just disregarded it. NEGATIVE 10 STARS IF I COULD.  DO BOT EAT HERE! HORRIBKE FOOD AND SERVICE!! This place is going down from the staff to the owner the ones who answer the phone are very rude they even forget to actually hit the Mute button and I hear everything they say about me as ohhh look who\'s calling your friend.! ( not professional) another thing is they aren\'t very friendly at all anymore as they were like 3-4 years ago the owner doesn\'t even care of the business as he did when he first started place is all dirty everyone is miserable and they don\'t get your order rite :/ sucks this place was one of very few that were good.... but if your in the 19149 area should try new England pizza on cottman and Brous I\'ve gone there 2 times so far not bad Today is 10/7/20, Goody\'s Pizza has completely lost my business. That last few times I have ordered from Goodys there has been an issue but kept giving them the benefit of doubt. I\'ve ordered thru Grubhub and it took Goodys 2 hrs to deliver. And every time i order a soda with my food, they forget the soda. I\'ve ordered pizza at least 3 times after that and the crust of the pizza was so thin it was paper like. Then I tried something different and ordered a tuna hoagie and Caesar salad for my fiancé. The tuna was so salty I took two bites and couldn\'t finish and they forgot the eggs on my fiancé\'s salad (which were ordered). Tonight was the last straw. I ordered pizza and fries which came to $21.23 it came on about 1/2 hr and I gave the delivery man $25 told him to keep the change. I brought my pizza inside and it was cold. One side felt like it was laying on something cold, called back to complaint and was told another pizza would take 15 mins. And I will have to return the cold pizza. Well it took phones back to Goodys asking where my pizza was and it took and hour for them to deliver another pizza. The pizza they brought back was Luke warm...I should have been the first delivery. I told the delivery guy to give me my money back. He gave me $13 back probably his tip money. Goodys pizza will not get business from me anymore. I gave them the benefit of doubt too many times and I can\'t continue to give them my money for bad services!!!!! I am an honest reviewer. Normally just take things on the chin and move on. I just want to say I have been supporting this business throughout the covid mess. As a single non cooking essential working man I have at least spent 450 or more in the last 3 months with this business.I am truly dissatisfied and disappointed with the service at this place. This is the third time my order has been miss delivered. I waited over 2 hours for them to get to me my pazzoriti that I ordered and pre paid for through paypal. I called a second time to voice my displeasure and was greeted by the manager who promised me he would make my order and deliver it himself. Needless to say I never received my item or a phone call. I just want to thank the manager for his non service and lack of gratitude for a loyal patreon. Also for helping me restart my diet for I will never order from this un-establishment again and keep the 7 dollars... This place has the most incompetent workers ever created by man. The past three deliveries have been wrong examples ordered a chicken Stromboli on multiple different occasions received a cheese STEAK Stromboli twice totally frustrating since no one in this house eats beef!! Hoagies I\'ve ordered bread is stale like rock hard stale like how did you even make this stale!! They usually are good with correcting their orders due to the  young idiot they have taking orders there are a lot of corrections trust me!!! Tonight 04/17/2020 I ordered pizza fries and some other items the hoagie had nothing we ordered on it the pizza fries had the extra cheese I\'d requested but no pizza sauce. My passive spouse calls and expected them to correct it as they usually do more then an hour later no delivery for an updated order. So now I\'m calling and the lines are continually disconnecting I\'m believing purposely because now I want my money back long story short this covid ish has their doors closed to customers like me that would normally be on my way for my money!!! Eventually spoke to a manager that could give a crap advised a refund will be on my card right away however there was no refund nor did they send a corrected order. My passive ass spouse paid me back for their piss poor service since he is obviously ok with being taken advantage of. Wow. Just... wow. First off, our order took an hour and a half to come. When I called the store to inquire the first person answered the phone "Goody\'s, please hold." Click. Didn\'t even give me the chance to respond. I was on hold for 3 mins and the line went dead. I called back. Immediately placed on hold again. When someone finally answered I informed her I was inquiring about my order. Her response... "ok, please hold." Click. Someone else picks up. I explain to her the situation. This young lady was polite. She told me if the order wasn\'t at my door in five mins to call back. Ok. \n\nThe food miraculously appears in five mins and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. I ordered a fried shrimp platter, which was supposed to come with 6 shrimp, fries and a side salad. I only received 5 shrimp and they were over cooked (they don\'t look like it, but they tasted burnt), the fries were just ok and the salad... look at the salad!! An onion sliver, a couple of green peppers and a small shred of romaine, DROWNING in ranch dressing. Fricking disgusting! How anyone could classify this nasty mess as a salad is beyond me! They clearly took ZERO pride in their craft and customer service (with the exception of the second young lady.) This type of disrespect will NEVER profit off of another coin of mine! We are done with Goody\'s. So I ordered a taco pizza and got a buffalo chicken pizza. When I called to say someone must have put the wrong tag on the pizza, I was told that the cook forgot to put the lettuce,tomato and sour cream on it.  I was then told they would send me out the toppings. A driver showed up with a container of lettuce, tomato and sour cream . So now I have to build my own pizza! If they cared about customer service they would have made me a new pizza correctly.  But not this place. Highly disappointed.  I used to love this place not so much anymore. Don\'t know if it is new management or just a lazy cook. GOODYS PIZZA (TACONY PA)HAS TERRIBLE SERVICE, POOR MANAGEMENT AND CAN NOT TAKE ORFERS CORRECTLY!!! IF YOU WANT GOOD ITALIAN FOOD--DO NOT EAT HERE!!! \nBeen going here on and off for a year now, they are always screwing up my delivery orders (which always takes over 1 hr to be delivered only 2 miles away!) . i am always giving them a 2nd chance but the service has only gotten worse over tje yarr and the orders are STILL wrong.  a plain salad does not mean just pick off the olives, onions and peppers- its disgusting, they are too cheap to simply put together a new salad. the bread is almost always burned to the point its like a rock or the bread will be not cooked at all, AND this is only if they actually remember to deliver the bread! many times i have had to call and complain about my order missing something that i was charged for. nothing is never done to correct the problems. Goodys has just lost themselves a good customer,  i can not continue to give them my money for wrong or missing food. \nAND trying to speak to a manager is a joke.  any person who picks up the phone will claim to be the manager. i wanted a refund after my last delivery was a disaster.  the food i ordered spilled out into the bag which was soaked when handed to me after being delivered, the bread was raw and the sloppy salad was wrong.  WHEN I CALL TO COMPLAIN -THE SUPPOSED MANAGER HANGS UP ON ME!! Such poor management, when asked where the driver was i am told "Oh I am not a GPS"...what real manger says that? \nI WOULD DEF NOT RECOMMEND EATING HERE!!! BAD FOOD, BAD MANAGEMENT AND WRONG ORDERS!!! CUSTOMERS BEWARE OF THIS PLACE THERE ARE BETTER PLACES TO ENJOY GOOD ITALIAN FOOD, NOT HERE THO!!\nGOODYS IN TACONY PA IS NO GOODYS AT ALL Wish I would\'ve read the reviews before ordering here. Ordered at 4:15 pm, food delivered at 5:30 pm. They only allowing delivery. (Why can\'t I pick up my food. I\'ll wait outside for it). Asked for onions chopped fine. I get long stringy onions. I\'m done with this place. 1st and VERY LAST TIME I\'LL ORDER FOOD HERE. I only order from here if it\'s my last resort ..their rolls are always soggy step up your game up and the Afro American counter girl needs to work in a ghetto pizza shop the epitome of ignorance They mess up way too many times, I am done with this place... Sorry Poppi you think I\'m a push over? Lucky I don\'t throw the food in you\'re face, tell you\'re non speaking English cooks to get it right... I\'m not going to pay for food that you think I should live with cause you got idiots who work for you besides the women who works the front. I thought you was cool bra! I have lived in this neighborhood for years and this used to be my go place when ordering out, however the original owner\'s sold the business & the name. These current owners are not doing a good job! On 2 different occasions I ordered a platter and both times they didn\'t give me sides with the platter. They have increased the prices and the service is terrible. I will no longer be ordering from them! It\'s pretty sad that a place that a place is about one mile from my house takes over 1-1/2 hours to deliver your food.  Previously had an issue where we ordered snacks and they didn\'t have what we ordered.  Instead of letting us know they substituted the order for what they decided was a fair exchange.  Don\'t recommend this place. Last week I ordered a medium white pizza with all broccoli. When my husband came home with the pizza no broccoli, I called and they were going to credit me a pizza since we didn\'t want them to bring the pizza back. I call tonight and Maria told me the credit was for half broccoli even though for a medium topping is $2.50. So she took $2.50 off and that\'s it. When I told her this would be the last time I was ordering she gave me complete attitude and said when one leaves two more comes. The managers name is Jose who she wouldn\'t let me talk to so I\'m sure they will be spitting in my food. I will never order from here again for how ridiculous Maris acted and for the fact I\'m paying for a pizza that should be free because the screwed up and we didn\'t have time to go get another pizza. Which really sucks because we really like there food. Oh well I\'ll find somewhere else where they actually care about there customers. ~Visuals\n\nThe place is about as average as you can imagine,very small and not much to brag about.but after all we care about the food right?\n\n~ Pizza\n\nNormally you order Pizza from a place like this so I did, the pizza well well above an average kind. With warm melting cheese with no burn marks underneath any of the slices, the dough was warm and soft and tasted as if this was prepared just for me. Leaving the conclusion to a \n\n~Pizza fries\n\nThe fries were delicious and well worth ordering for the 4-6$ the sauce was not cheap tasting or clumpy or too loose. However the cheese only covered the top leaving the fries at the bottom rather "naked"...but let\'s be honest the portion size is what gave me a better side to it,the portion was rather medium  but plentiful about as much as you are paying for it,rather large fries also.\n\n~ Burgers \n\nThe burgers they have are somewhat dry and no big taste, an average burger if you will. But for $3-$6 I would recommend trying another burger.\n\n~Delivery\n\nDelivery? Forget about it.. no place has ever taken more then 40 minutes then this place, not to mention being only around the block, But I am here to write truth. The people there don\'t seem to understand someone over the phone much without asking 3 times. The Manager has constantly apologizes about these things but never changes it. The delivery was more like a 2/5. Probably my biggest mistake. My first time ordering was tonight. Just a pizza, cheesesteak and some mini tacos. It took 2 hours to get my food (it\'s tuesday...seriously?) The manager was completely rude and even tried to double charge my card. The food was cold and nasty.  It immediately had my stomach doing twists and turns.  I\'d seriously burn the menu if I were you. Im new to the neighborhood and a neighbor gave me their menu to try it out. We ordered cheese steaks and they were pretty good.  So I decided to give them another try and order an steak panzarotti one night. I haven\'t laughed so hard in years,  they clearly have no idea what a panzarotti is,  the gave me this huge monstrosity that was doughy and not fried. I don\'t know why I can\'t find a good panzarotti in Philly,  but I know not to order it from goodys as well. Whopper with cheese, fries from mcd\'s 1000 yards away,  great meal\n\nExpect to wait a little longer if you go through the drive thru.  Always preferred burgers from burger king I swear to goodness nothing grinds my gears more than a drive thru asking me to drive to the opposite side of a building and wait for my freaking meal!  This store is off of my list of places I will spend my money! Ugh. I have to drive out of my way to wait for my food to come out of the front door! Smdh! Well let me take that back if the ceasur dressing wasn\'t soo good and if they didn\'t have whoppers I would have been outta there. Great service! Very affordable food and deals! Pretty good for a fast food chain! Never too crowdy ( i like that) and very fast service at the drive through as well. After waiting 7 minutes for a Whopper with cheese, everything on it and small fries, I get back to work and enjoy my cheeseburger...NOTHING on it. Seriously, you had one job!!! \nSeldom eat Burger King and this isn\'t going to make me want to come back anytime soon. DISGUSTING!! Burnt bread and hard burnt chicken! Cold hard fries! This BK at Ghetto Mills aka Franklin Mills bc Philadelphia Mills is just a ridiculous name! Time to close bc the service is slow and the quality is gross.  Close up shop and put a Chick-fil-A in its place. 0 Stars! I ran here because I needed something fast because I only had 20 mins between appointments and I was starving. They were out of Sprite which is ok because I understand that maybe they were waiting for their truck or any number of things could have happened. I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich with cheese and I GOT a spicy chicken sandwich NO cheese.  Disappointed. I\'m pregnant and I was really craving that.  . Absolutely disgusting wait time was horrible  18 minutes another five at the window we had a 40-something dollar order all of the meat was old nasty bread was stale horrible horrible horrible experience never again food was ratchet so where the employees would never recommend wouldn\'t feed this crap to my dog Ah, Burger king... a lifetime ago\nI would spend my lunch breaks here while "working" at walmart...I\'d have the latest pearl jam cd in the walkman (remember those things?) and a greasy whopper in my hands.\n\nGood times.\n\nThe interior of this joint has not changed at all since then. It\'s still just as grimey and just as dirty. \n\nThis section of Franklin mills has been dead for years and yet this fine restaurant continues on... Good for them.\n\nMust be those dag gone whoppers. \n\nNo real point to this review (it\'s BK afterall)- I just felt like taking a trip down memory lane. \n\nFries suck. \nWhoppers Good. \nrestaurant Dirty. \n\nTypical. I ate here on oct 4 2019  and got 2 whoppers with a free whopper . a few hours later i had the runs . I degrease my burgers with bounty paper towels  . I use to eat here around last year and the food was awesome . I will never eat here again . Just to be clear the next day i tried another BK and got the same 2 whoppers and no issues . Idiots! 9 minutes in drive thru for a cheeseburger! You might not like your job but you get paid to do it so do it. A nine minute wait for drive-through is ridiculous. It wasn\'t even a peek time Visited the restaurant on Oct 31st. in evening around 7pm.  I tried to avoid eating in Philly as much as I can to avoid that dumb sugar tax (.005 cent per ounce).  But the dinning room was clean.  I was served quickly and they got the order right the FIRST time.  That is 1st time I can say that about any fast food restaurant.  Didn\'t use the restrooms so I can\'t speak about it.  It only thing I hope gets better it that this area of the outside mall.  There aren\'t any others stores around this Burger King so with the exception of their outside parking lot lights everything is pretty much pitch dark. I don\'t want to give this place 1 star! We went there today the fryer was down but, you were able to still get burgers, we ordered 3 burgers only 2 were in the bag and we waited at the window for about 6 mins before they gave us the bag! We tried telling the server our order was wrong and she had the worst attitude, we asked for a refund and then the manager came to the window trying to force us to take the bag with the wrong food in it! This was the worst experience we\'ve ever had! This will be another place that will end up shutting down because of poor staff members. Food is usually solid, but recently they\'re not open with only a paper sign covering the speaker of drive thru. It be nice if there was an expected reopening sign or something. Waited in drive thru for 13 minutes only to come to the window and be told it will be another 6 minutes for my spicy chicken sandwich...ok fine\nSat out front for another 15 minutes \nFinally got my food brought out\nThe cheesy tots and fries were cold and stale like they had been sitting in the bag the entire time I was waiting\nThey couldn\'t even give me fresh fries for making me wait almost 30 minutes for an over cooked piece of fried chicken on a bun\nI don\'t eat fast food often so when I do it\'s a treat\nThis meal was a total disappointment \u200d\u200d\nI will not be back So I stopped in yesterday for lunch, got right on the highway after going through drive thru. I ate my lunch, it is what it is, I don\'t expect much from a fast food joint. Unfortunately I was pushed for time and it was my only option. I am disgusted! Nothing wrong with my food, my problem lies with what was in my drink and the attitude of the employee on the phone.\n\nI\'m a sucker for ice, I always chew ice and it can be a bad habit. Whenever I finish my drink, the lid comes off and I chew the ice. Well I took my lid off after drinking the entire soda and I notice something on the cup. It\'s mold! Yes MOLD! It\'s dry and hard and didn\'t come off of the cup. I snapped a quick picture. What\'s more disturbing is when I called the restaurant. I was told I must be mistaking and it\'s impossible. Well I\'m looking right at it. I asked for manager, not sure if it was really him or not. I wasn\'t looking for a free meal etc. I just wanted to make them aware of the situation. MOLD can literally kill you. Idiots! I will never go to this Burger King again! One star is a gift... Been 3 times, each wait time was over 30 minutes for the drive through. "Fast food" ...right.\n\nI was literally three cars behind the one ordering when I pulled up. I\'ve been through a Burger King drive through that has had way more in the que but they got through us in 10-15 mins?\n\nHIRE MORE STAFF and stop being cheap whoever is running this place. Not comming back lol Taco Bell is cheaper and quicker. I just went through their drive-through and it was ridiculous, not only did the girl who took my order not input it AT ALL but also once her supervisor came over and filled my order "SHE GOT IT WRONG". I was right there face to face and she "STILL" managed to get it wrong, I\'d made the drive specifically cause this location is normally better than the one that\'s closer to me but maybe Burger King is just not worth the money if they can\'t get anything right. Keeping in mind this is only a fast food restaurant, I understand that the service will not be aaaammaazzinng. However, I was highly taken aback by how rude the employees were and how slow the service was. I waited in line for 15 minutes and I ordered a number 4 meal. As I was leaving, I noticed that I was missing fries. I turned back into drive through, waiting another 10 minutes, only for the employee to tell me that I was lying about missing fries. They said that we ate the fries and was trying to steal food. As if I would wait in line for 10 minutes to get a free fry; I probably spent more money on gas in the line than the fries were worth. The manager did come and give us fries; however, because of them accusing me of stealing FRIES, I will not be going there again. Food was good, but the employee was extremely rude. I do love their food, but the customer service is something to be desired. My husband and I pulled up to the drive thru and the employee sounded miserable she straight up said "what do you want?" When she got on the mic. No hello, how are you, just "what do you want?" Seriously???? We\'ve also been sitting in the drive thru line for 15 minutes so far and there aren\'t a lot of cars. Unacceptable. When you work with the public you are being paid to take care of them. I don\'t care what kind of mood you\'re in or if you hate your job. Put on a fake smile and make money. BE PROFESSIONAL. Stop being miserable. It makes me sick that people who do that get away with it so easily. Cheer up, buttercup.\n\nPS I had to put my food in the microwave when I got home. Not cool. It\'s 8pm I\'m the only customer and it took 20 mins just to make my pizza and me receive it! The place was dirty and the employees were very unprofessional... good luck keeping your store open Sloooooooow service. Also calling in makes no difference. You still end up waiting a half hour for a single pie. So unprofessional. Basically like a high school clubhouse running the place. Which makes sense since we\'re dealing with $5 pizzas but really I\'d rather spend $15 to eat elsewhere. My time is money and this place wastes both of those. It was nice while it lasted. Sure service was slow and the hot and readys were never ready. For the price though I didn\'t mind waiting. Now without this there is only one local place to get a pizza and I liked little caesars better. Now I either get whatever is frozen on sale at Fresh Grocer. Or I buy pizza crusts from Aldi and use Don Pepino sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. The pizza wasn\'t bad, but getting it took so long and the whole messy process of what is going on in this location is really awful. On a Saturday afternoon, which anyone should expect to be busy, only one staff member was doing any work. Two women sat on phones while one man took orders, cleaned, made pizza, and handled upset customers. No pizzas could be in the hot and ready because he couldn\'t keep up on his own. This had been going on before we got there and the half hour we waited for our single pizza. I wanted to leave but my husband really wanted pizza. I felt bad for the staff member who was trying so hard when the other two didn\'t care at all that over a dozen people just stood around waiting. Terrible customer service, kudos to the one employee keeping your location open. Little Caesars has always been my go to. Having recently moved to point breeze I had to find myself a new location to eat at. Yesterday I found the one I won\'t be eating at again. \n\nAt about 9pm in desperation I stopped in to grab a pizza combo but was surprised by the door that was locked. I looked at the hours, still open! Then a girl wobbles over and unlocks the door and says "what do you want?" So I tell her my order. A pepperoni deep dish combo. And I\'ll grab my drink on the way out. I guess she didn\'t hear me over the conversation she was having with the phone shoved in her hood. And then another girl comes out and tells me we\'re all out of deep dish pizzas. I said I\'d wait. And she tells me, no there are no more. So I take a regular pizza instead. Then as I leave to get my drink, she informs me she rang the order in wrong. Calls her supervisor to find out how to fix the order and then tells me that it can\'t be reversed and I have to buy my soda separate. So I point to the menu where it says add a soda for 99 cents and she says sorry, that will be 2.47. As I left she says to me "ya\'ll need to speak up." And continues whatever conversation she was having with the phone stashed away in her hood. \n\nThank you for hands down the worst experience at any fast food chain I\'ve ever had. It was 8pm on a Sunday I went in there for a pizza and wings. The cashier didn\'t even speck to me she just say I only have pepperoni pizza. I was the only customer there . I ask you don\'t have wings either she says no. I\'m like so why are you open with no food? I looked all around\n\n             and\n\n              UP\n\n             and\n\n          DOWN \n\n            and\n\n       could find \n\n         no sign \n\n         of  ODB\n\n     at this McD\'s.\n\n     Hamburger.\n\n     Hamburger. I stopped at this McDonald\'s only because I happened to be passing through this area. I don\'t expect much from McDonald\'s but this place was clean and service was good enough. Lost my appetite. Ordered breakfast then went to use the restroom. Someone took a dump in the urinal and on the floor.  It smelled terrible. Couldn\'t eat my breakfast. As McDonalds restaurants go, this seems to be well run.  The food came out quickly and we were on our way.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, and even the bathrooms were well stocked.  Every worker was engaged and I was pleasantly surprised. Southwest Philly isn\'t really known for their restaurants.  Not even for their fast food restaurants because that\'s pretty much all they have.  All the fast food places I\'ve been in the area have had absolutely atrocious service and haven\'t been the most sanitary places either.  This McDonald\'s is actually a pleasant surprise.  The service is really quick.  Most the employees seem to be in good spirits.  The restaurant is clean and the food orders aren\'t all mixed up like other locations.  No problem coming back here again. One of the slowest and rudest McDonald\'s I\'ve come across. Food is nasty. Managers are unprofessional. If your food is incorrect they\'ll give you a attitude and question you to death before they fix it and like you\'re in the wrong. New management or close this location down. Terrible customer service after 10pm!!! Employees are texting while handle food even with the manager. Cashier did not know how to work self checkout machine and contents of the menu. Waited 20mins to find out my order was never put in the que so i am guessing they did not even have the self checkout linked to the machine behind the counter. Cashier too busy talking to his friends to even notice how long I was waiting for my food. I wouldn\'t recommend anybody to go to that McDonald\'s. McDonald\'s should have use their money for better employees instead of renovating that store. McEEK! ME THINKS NOT! McHeart failure, Mcliver failure, obesity #2 cause of MCdeath! McNever happening! This SouthWest Philadelphia McDonald\'s looks beautifully remodeled. However, the women\'s bathroom should be cleaned regularly. It appeared that it hadn\'t been completely cleaned for a while. It\'s bad when people don\'t want to work because the workers companies have to hire are the worst. These young girls that work at this location are horrible. No customer service better yet no manners. They are on their phones having personal conversations instead  of doing their jobs. They can\'t get the orders right. Don\'t waste your time at McDonalds. Please stop hiding burnt fries under fresh ones. Just throw them away. It\'s not fair to the customers especially during this Covid-19 quarantine when we cant come in and complain to receive immediate resolution. If you insist on getting McDonald from this establishment, I urge you to go in person. Do not, I repeat, do not order delivery. Every single time I do, half of the order is missing. My dumb a$$ kept giving them the benefit of the doubt and ordering anyway. Happened to me over 5 times . Lol , this place deserves NO stars ! Every single time I come here , they have an attitude and they get something wrong . How a business can be run with such incompetent people is beyond me. Even the manager can\'t get anything right but has the nerve to have attitudes .. what a joke . I ordered through Uber Eats and requested 2 happy meals . I received one . I reordered another happy meal and this time they gave me a Big Mac . How in the hell do you go from happy meal to Big Mac . Can none of you read an order screen ? Lol isn\'t that apart of your daily task ? Tsk tsk . Ridiculous came here at 5am, it says 24 hours on the front of the building and on google. i pull up to the drive through and the guy says "sorry were closed" i saw two employees walk in the side door. \n\nthis is what happens when you hire lazy people who dont care about their job and just want to get paid for doing nothing Employee yelled "CLOSED" as I drove through the drive through. All signs say 24 hours. If you\'re not open then you need to change them. This Wendy\'s is the worst Wendy\'s to go to . The food sucks , the service suck and the inside is always dirty . This location has the slowest service ever every time I go. It\'s ridiculous. Today I went and got the 4 for $4 because I refuse to pay $3 for 4 nuggets. So I got a baconator, 4 pc nuggets, an ice tea and fries. Why did every item I got had no flavor what so ever. My fries didn\'t have salt. My baconator was cold and tasteless. My nuggets were soggy and my ice tea that was suppose to be a sweet tea wasn\'t sweet at all. I\'m so tired of this place. I got a burnt baked potato  no friends ! Cook is BAD I think he is blind he don\'t know how to cook \u200d GO INTO TRASHHH I got burnt cheese on my baked potato how do u ever burn cheese unless u r BAD!!!!! The restaurant was extremely dirty. All the tables and the floor were disgusting. Two workers walked through the restaurant and didn\'t even seem to mind the mess. There was one person in front of us and our order took over 10 minutes. The worst! Eww I dont like Wendy\'s it looks nasty as hell food not good waiting long on order messed up my favorite food my Mcgriddls parfaits my all day breakfast They left a bean in my baconator fries, some beef in my sons baconator fries, and french fries in my nuggets. The most unorganized shit ever. Very disatissfied. Oh my god this place sucks.  I ordered cheese fries and I got a salad with brown lettuce.  How does that even work.  Yeah told the person that I ask for cheese fries and she took the salad out of my hand and put cheese on it.  I am so mad right now and hungry.  I cant stand this place but the plaza is good.  The only good stores is Fancy Face.  Honestly who\'s with me to shut down Wendy\'s,  Finally their always slow and the lines are short but it always takes long. At times, this store is fast and slow with orders. But now, there are times the store won\'t even have window drive thru orders and have customers come in. Like what\'s the point of having a drive thru is they keep on doing that. Plus, there are young workers in there that talks too much at times and not taking peoples order. But again, the food is still good, but at times, there are horrible workers. My favorite (and only) thing to get here is the Grilled Chicken sandwich. No matter what, their fries are always soggy so you might as well subsitute for something else like a baked potatoe (with cheese and bacon...mmm) or just ask for cheese fries. \n\nThe salads are pretty fresh. Their good if you\'d rather have something healthy. I see why they have 1.5 stars.  You pull up to the drive thru and get no greeting.  I place my order and I asked them to add cheese but no tomatoes and what did I get?  The exact opposite...no cheese with a tomato...and a charge for adding cheese! Too bad I didn\'t check my order before I left but maybe that\'ll be my practice from now on with all drive thru spots. Never again. My fries were cold and greasy. My chicken sandwich was burnt. The restaurant was not clean. Very nasty and unprofessional employees\nAnd on top of all that I had to wait over half an hour\nFor my good Samson killed 10,000 men with the jawbone of an ass. I\'m pretty sure this Wendy\'s is losing about that daily in revenue from the same instrument. I even called customer care about this one and I still have not heard from the general manager. But it tells me the moral at this store is from trickle down I don\'t care management. Welp won\'t be going back here. Not the cashiers fault or the one that made the sandwhich. I blame the cook.. and the manger had the nerve to ask if I want another sandwhich?Really totally discussed! This is terrible! Poison. I ordered a Homestyle Chicken and a Baked Potato. I got my food and my Chicken wasn\'t fresh. But the potato is worst. The potato look like it was left inside of the 1900s and teleported to this day. It\'s dry ,stinky and not servable. If I could rate a 0 I would. Food wise, I love this place. I work nearby and we don\'t have a ton of options, so it\'s nice to have a place with a healthy variety (pizza, salad bar, "international" food, kosher, grill). \n\nHOWEVER- every time I order food here I basically have to commit at least 30 min of my life to waiting around for them to serve it. The people who work here are at worst unmotivated and at best utterly confused. It\'s heating up a veggie burger, it\'s not rocket science. Last time I was there even though it was pretty empty they still had trouble figuring out what I had ordered (it prints out a receipt...)\n\nIt\'s pretty overpriced too. Lunch will run you like $12ish all told with fries+ drink. Food is ok, staff are generally nice. They used to be open until 1 am now they close at 8pm. And they got rid of the meat lasagna, which I loved. TheiThey\'re pricey though if you\'re not on a Drexel meal plan. I bought a fruit cup from Green St. Without checking price and it turned out to be $8!! Also, I couldn\'t even finish it because half the fruit was overripe. \n\nGood for Drexel students. If you don\'t have a meal plan there are better places to spend your money. As a visiting student this is by far the worst service that I have ever received anywhere. Mind you, i was just trying to order a regular smoothie. The African American lady behind the counter gave me attitude for just asking plain questions about the content of the smoothies. And the guy who was making the smoothies skipped the guy behind me just because he was looking down. Guiding the guy behind him to the front. He said that the weather was too hot outside and he didn\'t want to wait for anyone. I have never been to prison, but I\'m assuming this is how they treat the inmates in their food lines. You should hire energetic young students instead of these apathetic burnt out people. Smoothie on its own was delicious and highly recommended. Disgusting, overpriced garbage. Never, not once was it good. Please don\'t order the quesadillas. It\'s apart of Drexel\'s expensive meal plan. Freshmen are forced to eat there. Would never willingly eat their nasty food. Gets old real quick and lines are very long this place is the definition of . the food is not goo. Sometimes I just want to go and get decent food but it\'s hard to find. The people there are very nice though, so that is good. One of my favorites is the peanut butter toast or a smoothie. Urban is good because you can use meal swipes (hence one of the only reasons I go). If you ever eat at urban don\'t have high expectations. Sorry for this harsh review but I am just being honest. Food has been the hallmark of my life and the moment I layed my eyes on urban eatery i expected greatness. Pleasant architecture coupled with its premium location sets up urban to be simply awesome. All this changed the moment I went to order food. It\'s as though I had zoomed in on my microscope and was beginning to see the blemishes. There was food on the floor to my left and my right, but not from my order. Why was my order taking so long with 4 employees behind the counter. Now many people say the employees are unenthusiastic, but it understandable everyone has their down days, but this should not affect service. Other than getting a bagel (most of the time) all the other services take a solid 30 min so I could either go to class or wait on some subpar food, also the bagel machine constantly catches on fire. Changes need to be made. I was told my ambition can not wait but here I am standing in line for a simple request of chicken fingers. The new food court in the impressive Summit at Drexel is a great idea put into practice.  This architecturally appealing food venue with six different restaurants is open from 7 am in the morning until 1 am in the wee hours of the following morning.  From coffee and teas to health food, a deli, a pizza parlor, cheesesteak counter, Mediterranean and international foods along with several other offerings, there is certainly something to appeal to you.  There are varied eating areas attached to most of the restaurants or In the common dining room there are plenty of tables with TVs carrying the latest sporting events. Drexel students can eat here as part of their meal plan but others will find this food court handy because of its hours of opening and convenience to much of University City. Terrible service, ordered cheesesteak, takes so long, someone comes and orders one and got one right away. Thats was my fuckin cheesesteak!!! I don\'t know what happened but urban stepped up their game recently, no complaints. And there\'s lots of desserts. Terribly slow drive through service. I know they\'re new but they really need to step up their game! Came here recently for the first time in a long time. There was barely anyone in there, which is good because there\'d be no awkward accidental eye contact with strangers. Got a Big Buford, Bacon Checkerburger w/ cheese, and large fries. All were hot; fries were great and the burgers were pretty good. Cashier was chill, too. No issues like some other reviewers. So, yeah, it was pretty good. This checkers spot is good for their super hot wings. I get the bone-in ones. Dont expect sensational service or a social splender of sorts. There are mistakes made occassionaly. Stopped into checkers to grab a quick bite for my kids major FAIL! French fries barely any there and cold funnel cake fries look like a disaster nothing like the picture burgers asked for just ketchup they couldn\'t even get that right paid for 6 Apple pies got 3 I wouldn\'t advise anyone to waste their time here and then call the place to let them know and no one answers I\'m a fan of checkers when done correctly, the problem is most checkers locations are staffed poorly, and the consistency of food varies wildly depending on who\'s currently staffed, I\'ve been to the Roosevelt checkers 3 times during the last month, and all of the experiences have been as night and day to one another.\n\nPro-tip, avoid late-nights here at all costs, things turn out pretty terrible, half the time stocks run out, and buns are half stale. Another issue with this branch is just how slow everything is, even during the good times to visit, don\'t expect your food quickly.\n\nBest time to visit this checkers is around rush hour 4-5PM, the sooner the better- that late night shift swap is what kills it. Visit before last, couple weeks back me and a bud showed up late night, fries were over done, and less cold than you\'d expect, the buns felt like someone left the packaging open and they\'d been in the air for too long.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, immediately after work, food came out okay, buns weren\'t stale, fries were actually hot and not overcooked, order took forever as per usual, but it wasn\'t bad.  I cant really reccomend it, but i keep coming back hoping things will improve- when its good its pretty good, but too often it isn\'t.\n\nFlavor & Presentation 2.5/5   |   Service & Speed 1/5   |   Price & Proportion  3/5\n\nOverall 2/5 Always been a fan of checkers. Just the only problem not to many around. So when I found out this was going to be a checkers was kind kinda excited!! Glad that their is a sitting area on the inside compared to the one down the BLVD that\'s only the drive thru and if you want to sit and eat you have to sit outside... \n\nI\'ve always been a fan of the seasoned French fries some of the best around when it comes to fast food. The menu prices for food is great. Then they have the 2 for $4, 2 for $3 deals. With all different milkshakes. \n\nHope this checkers stays around for along time. Because ever since it use to be Taco bell back in the day this location turn in to Jack\'s way back burgers that didn\'t last to long. And with many other stores to shop. This Is a good spot to just get something to eat fast to eat when you are in a rush. The service was fast and so was me getting my food. Less then 5 min. Compete crap. This short dude. Who I think is the manager is always rude when I go. I gotta find out his name. So I can put it on here. He needs to get fired ASAP Rude obnoxious immature\nemployees....\n\nDirty lazy arrogant workers\nsub par food....need to call the board of health....Stay away from this location.\nThey mess up orders since baby employees are left to run the store. These guys are disgusting they touch everything with their gloves and never change them then touch your food with the same unchanged gloves makes you almost want to smack someone in the face they take forever and they make you spend all this money this  chick charged me for the meal when she told me they didn\'t have fries available and tried to say that I wanted mozzarella sticks in its place no she had to give me my money back for the fries their disgusting and they take forever someone call an inspector over there please don\'t eat here please. Do not go to this branch ever!!!!!  \n\n    we came to this drive thru hoping for great food at a good price. On the website they had a deal that show you could get 4 items for 3$, nothing about what comes in it, or the conditions. we get to the drive thru at night. The lady cuts me off in the middle of my order to let me know that this was what they had on hand, and that they were not cooking anymore. After taking my order and not taking time to explain the deals, that could save me 5 bucks, we ordered; 4 cheap burgers, 2 boxes of fries, 3 boxes of bites and fries, and a side of wings.\n\n   We get done with ordering, and she cant not give me a total, after telling the next person at the window about the web site, he closes the window and takes forever to make the food. the then  stand around laughing at the order. Our food come out and that his point the person at the window asks if he would like to see my manager. There is a 7 car line behind us so i decline telling them i will call tomorrow. I pull into an empty spot to check the order and can see the manager and works laughing at the order paper they just printed from our food. \n\n   but it gets worse. The fries are rock hard the burgers are cold and the boxes are missing the sauce. If this is great customer service then I hate to see what bad looks like.\nI will be calling corporate tomorrow and updating this review on my findings.\n\nworst burger and fries that has ever been served to me.\n\nDo not go to this branch ever!!!!! Food had mold on it, will not come again to any Checkers in the City of Philadelphia. I stopped here with my son because he was bugging me to get Checkers I said NO at first but he talked me into going- I wish I stuck to my guns on not going because the food was just what I thought it would be gross & and soggy. The cheeseburger looked like something that was plopped together tons of may ketchup and mustard on the bun that it made the rolls soggy. Checkers needs to focus on making better food or I am afraid they will be shut down soon and be just a memory. Do Not go here. Can they sparw the condiments? I asked for extra condiments on all of my sandwiches because I know they are very skimpy with them. All of my sandwiches were very dry and almost inedible. Also none of them were labeled. People don\'t like you to have to open every sandwich to find out what they are! Skimpy on napkins. Forgot or did not have part of Grubhub order, but still charged for it.\nDon\'t waste your time! Is it even open?? Got there to pick up my food no lights inside, no cars around. I don\'t understand why indicate on google that it\'s open for dine in, pick up?!? And I got there 30 min after opening. Called 2x no one picked up. Lol If I could give them ZERO stars, I would. Their lack of customer service was astonishing...initially I was concerned that my order wasn\'t processed correctly because the delivery was 30 minutes past due. \n\nWhat was ordered? I wanted to try a chicken and bacon panini...got some awful looking hoagie with mystery meat. Also ordered 10 piece mild buffalo wing, what arrived was a boneless BBQ nuggets. \n\nBusiness refused to refund or replace order upon notification, the only response was "they prepared the correct food". \n\nWhere did Ray\'s lunchbox wrapping paper come from?! Used to be one of my favorite spots on my take out rotation until today. \n\nFirst I\'ll state the obvious: no business is perfect and everybody has off days but in my books its 3 strikes and you\'re out... like this place. \n\nNo pleasure in doing this today but, i ordered a cheesesteak with extra meat and fries before and it was great. Ordered today and it was atrocious... extra meat? I got maybe half of a regular order and the fries were crushed upon delivery. Charged me approx $19, yes $19, for some flimsy cheesesteak and crushed fries... didn\'t even send ketchup packets. \n\nLong story short the food quality and portions are never consistent. You could order something once and love it but the next time ask yourself "what is this?". Worst experience ever. I understand that it\'s  after new years but that no reason to show a terrible attitude to paying customer. Seamless told me the meal was accepted and in the process of being made. Never made it to my door. This place leave you irritated and even hungrier. Deserves to be shutdown I tried this place after moving to the neighborhood. It was puzzling- it was a good location, good prices, great environment, clean, so why is this place always so empty? After a couple visits it was starting to become pretty clear. \n\nYou can do everything right, but if the food isn\'t up to par, nothing else matters. The owner cooks everything, and the guys working there seem nice enough, but if you don\'t know how to make the food, or at least understand how the food is supposed to be made, you\'re not gonna get very far.\n\nThe first time I ate there, I ordered a lamb gyro. You would think this would be no problem as so many middle eastern places have gyros, but no. I open it up to take a bite and there were pickles! He asks me what\'s wrong I\'m like, there\'s pickles on it? And he\'s like yeah! As if that\'s normal. I told him I\'ve never heard of such a thing, all my life I\'ve never heard of pickles on a gyro. He told me there was no more lamb so I had to settle for chicken.\n\nI decide to give them a second chance, and I order the quesadilla special. Skeptical, due to my last visit, I ask what kind of cheese is on the quesadilla. I\'m told its  CHEESE WHIZ and AMERICAN. He wasn\'t joking. I told him just give me the cheese you use on pizza. I open it up when I get home and all the chicken is in a ball in the middle of the tortilla.\n\nThe owner might be a good businessman, have a great dining room, location, everything, but he does not understand food. ** If he would just hire a half way decent cook, this place would probably be poppin. ** A name change might be necessary though because it\'s hard to shake a bad reputation. I would love to be able to support their business since they\'re syrian and we have destroyed their country, but if the food sucks nothing else matters. Good ingredients, just doesn\'t know how to put it all together. If I could this place negative stars I would! I order food and an hour later these incompetent people called me back saying they were closed and weren\'t delivering my food anymore. First they tried to say they were on the way and couldn\'t find my address although it was only 2 blocks away from their location, then when I explain to them where my address was they come up with a new story about how they are tired and they don\'t feel like delivering my food. (It was. Nowhere near closing time) Do not order from here !!!!! These people are rude and racist. Racist...we were treated horribly. Absolutely horrible. Do not eat here. The owner was not nice at all-he looked mortified when we walked in but we just assumed he had a busy day. We were wrong. He didn\'t even want to take the order... He literally stared at us, took a doop breath, and reluctantly wrote what we wanted. We should have left but we didn\'t-bad judgement. We paid and waited...half our order was wrong. Then we got it correct but it was half done. The chicken fingers were not done in the middle and the cheeseteak had hardly any meat-& i paid for extra meat. We asked to use the restroom to wash our hands and we were told there was no restroom available. Then a younger Caucasian woman walks in, asks to use the restroom without buying anything, and is immediately taken to the restroom. We left at that point. It\'s sad because it is a great location but disappointing because the last thing you expect coming into that establishment is racism.... Horrible. I ordered at 8:30 and after it being over 45 minutes, I called and they said it was on it\'s way. I called again after 60 minutes late, and they said it never went out even though they had received the order at  8:30. Got a full refund through Grubhub. Hate this place, don\'t order. Well to start off... delivery service is horrible. Waited 1 hour and half for our meal and they are 6 blocks away. I know I could have picked it up but was chilling watching football.  After all that wait the Stromboli was mediocre. Plain chicken Stromboli, no onions, peppers. Was just warm... the fries were hot.  Won\'t be ordering here anymore. UPDATE: I added a screenshot of the owner calling my order fake. This is how he treat his customers. Don\'t order from here unless you want to be treated like shit. ------- \nSo I ordered by phone 2 hours ago and I\'m STILL waiting for my food. I thought it would\'ve been a fast delivery since we\'re only 8 blocks away. I called an hour ago and he told us our food was on the way. It\'s a 9 minute drive and he\'s telling us the food the food was on the way an hour ago?! This is ridiculous. The worst delivery I\'ve ever had. ******zero stars*****\n this is the worst brick oven pizza i have ever tasted.  salt was used as a main ingredient.  do not buy anything! disgusting!  vegetable pizza was thrown away by everyone of my super bowl guest.  this business needs to be sold to someone who knows how to prepare food, period! Horrible. Not only is the wait time completely ridiculous, but the food is awful too! 2 sandwiches took 40 minutes! The pizza isn\'t too bad but try getting a sandwich, they will screw it up and once they make u a new one it will taste horrible. Management is also horrible and doesn\'t know how to handle a customers dissatisfaction and was so incredibly rude. Never again will I come back here and will tell everyone I know never to come here. Awesome chicken parm grinder. Chicken cutlet so fresh and crispy. Perfect amount of sauce and cheese. Would recommend!! Been with these guys for a year now. Always forgetting something so make sure u always repeat yourself. 9/10 they still will forget something. Recently i can into the store and ask them to make sure they put ketchup in the bag they said yeah. I get home and theres nothing in the bag. I call to make a complaint and the manager refuses to take the phone. Just kept passing messages back and forth. I was being super polite and nice but that was totally unprofessional. How in the world can u run such an unprofessional Business. Let alone my husband said he seen the guy digging up his nose and wipped it on his apron while my husband was picking up our food a few weeks ago and he had to let the guy and manager know. Ever since then when ever that cook is there we dont order. Time to find a new place. No matter how far the drive is. After dealing with less than friendly service while trying to place my order, I stupidly went ahead and ordered anyway. Today is freezing and I wanted some quick delivery. \n\nThe delivery guy was friendly and didn\'t take too long, so I tipped him handsomely. \n \nI ordered the cheesesteak lunch special and 6pc honey bbq wings.\n\nThe cheesesteak was absolutely disgusting.  I took one bite and trashed the rest. The fries were above average,  but the chicken was very disappointing as well. The meat on the sandwhich looked questionable, as if it may have been left over meat that sat on the grill overnight from yesterday....it seemed to be spoiled as well judging by the smell, color, and texture.\n\nThe chicken meat was very tough,  and I could tell it was very quickly and carelessly sauced. I only ate 2 of the 6.\n\nNeedless to say. I will not order from this place ever again. I order from Sam\'s pizza a lot. I tried and love their pizza, cheesesteaks, hoagies, calzone and stromboli\'s. I did get a delivery that was not hot but other then that their great. The literally charged me $17 for something that should\'ve been $12 just because I didn\'t mention the special. ITS AN EVERYDAY SPECIAL. Will not be ordering again. When I asked the lady lied saying she was the boss and only told the truth when I told her to come get the food. Never got any type of refund because I would have to come to the store and I couldn\'t which is why I ordered delivery. Instead was offered store credit which is WORTHLESS cause I will never be going back again! horrible!!! customer service suck, lady was on her cell phone all time dealing with me as a paying customer... food was bad to the point i had food poison, i hope this place goes out of business $6.75 for the super steak.  One table so take out recommended.  The Cheesesteak had a good taste but there were pizza boxes everywhere and the extras seem better suited for a pizza.  Very juicy cheesesteak which led to a complete roll failure.  In the video I am holding the Cheesesteak upside down.  $6.75, in a pinch, what the heck. This place is horrible. \nAgainst my better judgement I got a chicken cheese steak for lunch.  OMG!!! It was so salty.\nI totally got food poisoning later on in the day.  And this coming from a man who has a cast iron stomach.  \n\nI do not recommend this place. This place was great as I was growing up but as the neighborhood is falling into ruins, the original owners have fled and the name is the only thing left. In this case, the name is not even the same, it\'s something like Papa Sam\'s now, and it is terrible. The quality of their product is way down while the prices remain the same. Pizza, sandwiches and sides are all bone standard at best and inedible at worst. Don\'t even bother. This place suckssss..... I ordered some food, and after 45 minutes I called and they said its on the way...... An hour later I called once again.... This time they said I never place an order, there was nothing in the system. I was upset, so I just canceled the order..... 25 minutes later, the delivery guy knocks on my door with my order. Told him he could keep it. We\'ve ordered from Sams for years with the prior owners and they were great. But now they have new owners and the food isn\'t good anymore. And every time we order the person who takes orders send our order to the wrong address. It\'s happened with our last two orders. We won\'t order there again. It took almost two hours for our order to finally arrive both times. I have been ordering here for years and today I was told that I no longer can receive orders at my address. When I say I literally order here at least 2 times a month over 5 years  and I have never had an issue with this place but one time and now I\'m banned from ordering. I\'m just gonna run down my situation real quick. I order a large pizza and a cheese steak one day and was told it was a 45 minute wait which I didn\'t mind because I was home getting ready to leave in about 2 hours. It took over a hour to get to me still no problem. At the time they had a deaf driver that I was unaware of because again I always order here and that has never happened. I called looking for my food and was told the driver already came to my house and I didn\'t answer through text. Mind you I was getting ready and I didn\'t have my phone in my hand but I would\'ve heard it if it had ring. I asked why didn\'t the driver call me like they have always done and at that moment she told me the driver was deaf. I than asked her well he could\'ve knocked on the door. Because my food was already paid for I paid over the phone with a card. She said she don\'t know and that I could get a refund, so I said ok I\'ll take the refund because now I\'m about to leave my house. I didn\'t think that my house would get banned from ordering at a location I\'ve been ordering from for years because I was unaware of their new driver and his conditions. And I felt like I was not at wrong for any of it. Maybe a better system from them due to them having some one with a disability. I can honestly say I salut that man for working during the pandemic. But to banned me from something like that is crazy. I wasn\'t rude or anything, I\'m always nice and always tip! But it was nice doing business. I\'ll just have to take my business to another place. I found mouse droppings in the pizza box when we order 3/28/. My family ate 3 slices before we noticed, luckily no one got sick. I called them up to tell them about it, and they denied any wrong yet they didn\'t ask to see the pizza, the box, or anything before refusing to refund my money or replace the pizza. The way the owner was acted seemed he has something to hide. I was a frequent customer until this incident, and referred others. Needless to say I will not be ordering from here again, told my friends i referred, and filed a complaint with the health department. I urge people reading this to not order from here until they pass inspection and if they do to please check your food. If I could give 0 stars I would. Terrible management. The guy that came out and told us to leave was very rude, we spent over $100 and were told to leave because we wouldn\'t buy another hookah. Customer service is a must and that is where they lack. Spend your money elsewhere!!!! The hookah is not great at all. The service was even worse. Do not come here. I will not be coming here again. The first time I went I was willing to excuse it as a fluke, after the second time I\'m done with this place. It was okay. The atmosphere needs work. They were playing some kind of narco shit on the TV which it\'s not something to vibe to while hookah. The music needs a little work too. The guy who "served" us seemed nice enough and made sure we were go with the hookah.\u200d Overall...meh. I went here after dinner with friends to continue. birthday celebration. The owner or manager was very rude about seating. He wanted to place a party of 3 at a cramped table for two. He also made us order two hookahs because we could not share (only two per hookah). We were charged for bringing our own alcohol as well. The actual hookah wasn\'t bad just don\'t get the peach.I probably won\'t be back here however. Try Hubble Bubble. I was a customer of this place on a Saturday night, where it was pretty packed. 30 minutes into my time being here i and my friend were thrown up on by another customer.  It was a very uncontrolled atmosphere.  Someone else threw up on us from being too drunk. No one from the establishment even came over to apologize to us, or better yet help us get someone else\'s VOMIT off of us. We had to get our own napkins and sit by this vomit for at least 10 minutes.  When we went to leave, we were also overcharged, and they charge $5 per person to BYOB.  No one from management apologized to us about having someone else vomit on us until we complained.  Not a professional service at all.  Service was also terrible to round it out ! Thank you for charging us $50 to be thrown up on :)\n\nEdit: after posting this they sent me this harassing message proving their professionalism :) Cloud Factory has great hookah deals during the weekdays I love their specials! The service is exceptional and the servers are so attentive and personable. I can\'t wait to be back in. I\'ve been here a couple of times since the place opened and it\'s a great vibe! You have to try out their tea selection + the mango juice! Also, the place is byob and has outdoor seating! In a great location right in the center city area!! Will be back soon! Also, shout out to the people who make the hookah Probably the worst service I\'ve ever experienced with a hookah lounge. The people were beyond rude when we walked in, didn\'t greet us or anyrhing. After walking in and asking about seating and details, he told us we had to buy at minimum 3 hookahs when there was 5 of us. On top of that, I called before we went and they never told me anything, just said that since we are buying food and what not our accommodation could be made. Literally so rude  and misleading, wasted time and money going there just to walk out due to its bad service. Never coming back here and a damn shame considering it was the first hookah lounge I\'ve been to in Philly. It was dead with bad music and it genuinely felt like they were ripping us off because there was no one there. Rude and unprofessional. not friendly people working there. money we paid for 2 people just for one Hookah was very expensive and didn\'t even change our Hookah.Hookah place suppose to be nice and relaxing but I was so stressed out because of people who couldn\'t do their job. They didn\'t even tell us that we have to pay first and then we can have it. Why to open business like that if you don\'t know how to make your place number one destination for us. Eating there I wouldn\'t even suggest it. Really dirty , seating area was not comfortable at all. If you want to enjoy your time with your friends in Hookah place don\'t go there, you will be very disappointed. Go somewhere else not clean at all prices are a complete ripe off! They played the same songs over and over for hours! Cloud Factory, a recent entrant to the Philadelphia Shisha scene is one of the best lounges in the city in my opinion. Within a week, I introduced this place to a couple of other friends, fellow hookah aficionados who were quality appreciative of this place. They do not have an expansive food menu like some of the other hookah bars, but they make a fine shisha. The cafe is BYOB, so you do have an option to pair your shisha with drinks of your choice. I recommend mixing a fruity flavor (grape, orange, kiwi) with paan rasna for a minty, refreshing experience. Man if COVID wasn\'t happening I would of took my business else where. Giving the one star is being generous smh... I don\'t know where to even begin. That receptionist or whoever this guy was provided TERRIBLE customer service I don\'t even know why he even works there because it seemed as though he didn\'t want to be there. Let my list all the things that was wrong with the service:\n1. Person working there was NOT wearing a mask\n2. He did not sanitize any tables after a customer left\n3. No toilet paper in the bathroom\n4. They had two doors and one was locked so I knocked on the door and the person working there didn\'t even get up he just yelled from where he was sitting to use the other door... atleast put a sign on the door saying you want us to use the other door.\n5. Music... SUCKED. Luckily I was able to request songs but if I didn\'t we would of been listening to rap music all night long.\nThere\'s much more I want to add but this is the gist of it. If you want a night out... don\'t go here. I Two stars because I really like the design and layout of the lounge but man the hookah is horrible. The actual hookahs were fake and not Egyptian Khalil mamons like other places. The tobaccos burns after 15 mins of smoking because of small hookah head with gigantic coals. Good vibes tho, management just needs to step up their hookah making game lol Great ambience, recently opened lounge with a great feel, vibe and music to it. A definite must see when in Philadelphia and a sure fire way to get some calm and ease after a long, tough day at work, or if you\'re just travelling in the city for pleasure or business, it\'s also a great place to be able to get work done when the need arises. As far as the drinks, the lassi is a great touch not usually found at a hookah bar, so it was a great sight to see. I ended up smoking paan, pineapple and mint which have a great taste, and smooth clouds. I\'ll definitely be back whenever I\'m in town. If I could give this place zero stars I would. This place is straight trash and disgusting Looks like a dorm room. Bathrooms were filthy, they\'re over priced and manager was a dickhead. The hookahs would prolly give you upper respiratory infection. Stay away or god bless. What an awful place, hookah was broken! Bathroom was run down and dirty. Server was twerking and eating left 4 tables with no help... Great location but horrible business , officially never going back ... Bad customer service, bad chicken, overall just bad experience. Hard no. Try love & honey fried chicken down the street. Makes this place seem as if they serving Mcchickens. I don\'t understand the negative reviews. We just ordered and everything was great. Either people are just haters or they fixed whatever problems they had before. Ugh, I feel bad. I hate to leave such a negative review but unfortunately, this place really needs to improve if they are going to make it in this neighborhood, especially since we have excellent fried chicken from places like North 3rd, Silk City, and Love & Honey in Northern Liberties. \xa0 As you can see from the photos, the items were a huge disappointment. \xa0The tenders were terrible - not crispy at all. Nothing in our entire order was crispy. Their crust flavor and color was very strange. \xa0The chicken and waffle sandwich was deconstructed - was I supposed to make it into a sandwich myself? Maybe. It was two pieces of very soggy waffle, another piece of chicken that looked and tasted like the tenders and two pieces of old, limp pieces of bacon. No one, not even our kids would touch this one. The chicken sandwich was decent but not good enough to order again. We also got the pickle butt which is such a small thing but anyone paying attention to assembling the sandwich should have seen that and discarded it. \xa0Another huge problem (as one of the other reviewers pointed out in a Goonies-esque comparison) \xa0is that the pick-up spot is inside Vesper pool club which is closed and shows no signs of life. \xa0No lights were on - why? \xa0Turn a light on for goodness sake if people are coming to pick up orders. \xa0Look welcoming. The people were extremely rude and acted as if they were doing me a favor by grabbing my order. \xa0It was all very confusing and disappointing. This is probably the worse sandwich I\'ve had.  I drove all the way in town for what looked like a great sandwich on Instagram but was very different in person.  It\'s not that it was a messy sandwich, especially when the chicken is juicy. (A problem that can be solved with a 528 foot stroll...)\n\nAfter hearing about Hunnies Crispy Chicken opening up in NoLibs I was excited to check them out. I got on their Instagram account and saw that their food looked great, received some good publicity from some of the local food bloggers, so today was the day I decided to try them out! I got on GrubHub and ordered a good amount from their menu to try everything out. I ordered a Hunnies Crispy Chicken Sandwich, , Crispy Chicken Wings, fries and Crispy Cauliflower Bites. \n\nHere is my experience:\n\nI parked and walked over to the address listed, which is a swim club and restaurant owned by Vesper. There was a handwritten sign on the door that read, "Hunnies Crispy Chicken pickup inside." I opened the door and there were zero people in the building. No customers and seemingly no one working. Someone finally came out and muttered something inaudible. I said I\'m here for a food pickup for chicken. I was totally confused because there was no signage anywhere. Lights were off, chairs up. It looked like the fucking abandoned Italian restaurant from Goonies. I was expecting the Fratelli\'s to offer me some water with bits of shit floating in it. That would have been preferred compared to what I got.\n\nThe Sandwich: It was flavorless. The chicken was lacking any flavor what so ever. As if it was flown in from Utah by Mitt Romney himself. That would at least explain why the "crispy" chicken sandwich was anything but crispy. It also featured a watery slaw that only added some slight texture and color. The sandwich was a fail. \n\nWings: I ordered these wings WELL DONE, because I know what steam can do to wings. I opened the box and of course the wings were anything but well done. They were soggy and unappealing. They reminded me of Chunk from Goonies in a lot of ways. Full of promises and stories, sloppy and unkept. They were actually the best thing I ordered. The wings had decent flavor but were almost inedible due to their soaked nature. \n\nCauliflower Bites: There really isn\'t anything to be said. Just totally forgettable, sorta like Martha Plinpton\'s character "Stef" from Goonies. What ever happened to her? No one knows...just like these goddamn cauliflower bites. \n\nFries: They were sort of crispy but not really. I mean, how do you fuck up fries? My favorite part of the fries was the ketchup, WHICH I HAD TO PAY FOR!! 50 cents for ketchup....was this homemade ketchup or was this Hunts? I ask because these unprofessional buffoons would probably use hunts over Heinz. (Heinz is the GOAT, don\'t @ me)\n\nOverall this is another example of really good looking Instagram photos that don\'t live up to the hype. Not even close. There is far better fried chicken options all over Philly. Look for them and go there. Based on reviews I\'ve seen they have a repeating issue that in my mind is easily addressed. How do you have the word "CRISPY" in your business name and nothing is crispy? How do you NOT know how to fix that easily fixable problem? I found this place to be totally unprofessional, from the sign outside to the execution of the food. \n\nAnd if you are ever in Northern Liberties and listen closely you can hear the muffled sound of Sloth screaming from the basement of this fried chicken hell hole. Just kidding, thats probably the ghost of my explosive diarrhea this food caused me to have. Cars. parked all over sidewalk,  young people hanging around outside smoking blocking entrance, very uninviting. I can see why the previous rating was bad because it seems it is more of a hangout than a place preparing good food. It\'s a shame because there wings are the best in my opinion in the area and they have good cheesesteaks. My problem is they always take 2 hours to deliver my food. 2 hours. I can understand one but c mon. This has happened three times already and I\'m really tired of it I haven\'t been to this spot since it was Georges Pizza so I wanted to give the new ownership a try. The cheesesteak and fries were good and the cook who may have also been the owner or manager was the only professional person in there. There was two other workers behind the counter who look like they might\'ve been in there early to mid twenties. And they were cursing from the time I ordered to the time I got my food. One was a female working the register and the other was a male basically just standing around but he did answer the phone a couple times. The female wasn\'t that bad but every other word out the males mouth was profanity. Sadly the cook didn\'t bother to stop them. \n\nI may order from there again but I definitely won\'t be stepping foot into that place.\n\nYes we\'re in the hood but come on...this is a business! This place food is nasty everyone in there is young and they rush with your order,, ordered chicken wings they were so salty and yo much breading, never ever again will I give this place my money. decent prices and the pizza crust is good but they didn\'t give me what they offered on their pizza. Sure I had special instructions to remove 2 ingredients and sub them for 2 others, but it missed the ingredients it was supposed to have that I did actually want on the pizza.\n\nI ordered the paradise special pizza (which is pepperoni, sausage, green onion, mushroom, tomatoes, onions and black ollives) with no sausage and no green peppers, but add ham, fresh garlic, extra cheese and extra sauce. Now yes they abided to eliminating the sausage and green onion and adding the ham and garlic, but the pizza also did\'t have the tomatoes or black olives on it. Ingredients that come with it that I DID WANT on the pizza! I ordered 20 hot wings wich came dry, burned, old and hard. They sent a second order wich came dripping sauce all over my steps and the bag busted dripping juice everywhere. I spent 10 minutes clean my walk way,  steps and the trail from my front door to my kitchen.  I called to speak with the manager and give him my experience and just brushed me off. This is the worsed experience of my life in ordering take out or as a delivery driver. I well never order from this place again. I ordered pizza and a couple of additional items. The food was good and the delivery was quick! One thing I found convenient is the fact they stay open late, overall good experience We got delivery from Sorrento. Delivery was fast and friendly.\n\nPizza was fine, nothing great and nothing wrong.\n\nChicken wings were overcooked, too hard and too dry. They were also supposed to come with celery but there was no celery included. I would avoid chicken wings from here in the future. I ordered delivery from here during the Covid-19 lockdown. \n\nI ordered the spicy chicken panini and an order of garlic knots. The garlic knots were great, but I did not have enough marinara sauce for all the knots and I\'m not a big dipper. \n\nThe spicy chicken panini however was a massive disappointment. The bread was smashed thin and not a great quality. The sandwich was soggy and not very tasty. Also, it was not even the least bit spicy. I would refer to it as mild. There was a thin layer of a lettuce that didn\'t go very far. I definitely will not be ordering it again and the presentation itself was a turn off. Overall, it was a waste of money. Replacing the bread with a ciabatta would be a world of difference. \n\nThe garlic knots were a bargain for the portion size. Only $5!\n\nThe panini was a waste of money at $9.\n\nI removed the food from the styrofoam packaging as a precaution. Got delivery of some cheesy fries and a milkshake from Sorrento. As it was late at night, this was one of the only places open. Overall, average quality ingredients and alright mega fries. Was wary since other reviews were lower, but for average pizza shop stuff late at night, it\'s pretty alright The WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Pizza was over an hour late and the employee told me to "just wait" and then hung up on me.  Never recommend this place. Margarita pizza was something out of Kitchen Nightmares but I wasn\'t expecting much. \n\nQuesadilla was alright. My pizza never arrived.... I waited for 2 hours before calling Grubhub. Avoid at all costs. Food came 2 hours later, chicken fingers half cooked & forgot my whole pizza.. Left the food on the wrong step. Customer service is at the floor DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION!!! We have been waiting since 6:51pm it\'s now 7:58pm. When we called to store they said it was a 2 1/2 delay. When we placed the order they never told us this! Unbelievable service, thank you Caroline, as well as the other staff who help me. The best food, and the nicest service ever. I will be back Me and my family have been ordering from this Dominos for years and I\'m truly sick of the disrespectful manner these workers treat their customers. I love the food that Dominos\' chains carry but this specific store screws their customers over in terms of food quality as well as respect to the customers and the list of why goes on. About three times have me or someone else in my family ordered cheesy bread in there which is supposed to already come with one marinara sauce cup, and when we called to tell them that we didn\'t receive it the person on the phone says that they will send someone to bring it for us and they straight up never will. Pizzas by them have either taken hours upon hours to come even after the deliverer has left and someone said they\'re on their way or when the pizza(s) arrive, they will have a limited amount of sauce or be cold or taste way too salty. Refunds from that place haven\'t been nice either, because way too many times have I reported it on the website that eventually we couldn\'t even get credit anymore for the faulty order; it would say we have to call the store to complain, and THAT clearly doesn\'t get anything done. It\'s like they don\'t care what people have to say to them over the phone at all, or that you\'re talking to poorly trained employees moderated by careless, incompetent managers. Just today was the last straw when we ordered two pan pizzas that arrived lukewarm with stiff cheese and hardly any sauce. When one of us called to notify them about it, a woman answered the phone with an attitude saying that we should have "ordered extra sauce if we wanted it". Like, seriously? Attached is the pizza in question. \nTo conclude, this Dominos needs new or completely retrained employees and new management. Someone in a higher position at the Dominos company needs to seriously with their own eyes how this chain is operating. Food was terrible \nChicken appeared to be half done\nChicken was barely sauced\nPizza was missing toppings\nDough was half cooked ended up eating the meat off the pizza This is the worst place in the world when it comes to handling business. I placed order at 4:21pm at 2 hours later I call to check only order they slapped the phone on my face. I call 4 times still hanging up on me when I ask about my order. At 6:45pm I received notification to enjoy my food and my order was delivered but I never got it. When I called, woman was very disrespectful and told me to file a complaint if I want. The also make the worst food in all domino\'s locations. This people do not really represent dominos. The oxtails, rice and beans had no flavor. I got 3 small oxtails that\'s dry & a platter full of rice. I asked for extra extra gravy they did not give it to me. The cabbage was good. I waited for my food for 1 hour I paid for large salmon and got small portions it was cold and taste horrible the cook didn\'t have on a mask and she came out front and took care a costumer who didn\'t have on a mask and went back to cooking.  The greens had more peppers in it than green. When I got home the wrong food was in the bag after waiting an hour I just ordered 2 pepper steak platters  with mac and cheese collard greens for pick up when I got there to get the order first I was told they had no greens so i opted to have Mac and cheese and yams  the price for medium platter on their menu is $ 12.00 per platter on the T.V. in the restaurant even states that the platters are $12.00 (WRONG )\n I was charged $14.00 per platter  and then to make matters worst the platters was like we ordered a MAC and CHEESE platter cause they had a lot of that with no cheese and the pepper steak was like eating roast beef there were no peppers in it and the yams was entirely too sweet and then when my husband called the woman wanted to argue with him He told them it was like ordering a Mac and cheese platter with the steak and yams are the sides FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and the food is not worth the money they don\'t have a large selection of food for now on I will use my gas to go else where I placed a $56.00 order and it got cancelled- now I was to wait 5 days for it to drop from my account- what kind of garbage business is this? If you\'re not taking orders, I\'d suggest you post it otherwise- I\'ll take my business elsewhere. Absolutely disgusting. I will NEVER order from here again. If I could put negative stars I would! I couldn\'t even eat my food. \nI ordered through Uber Eats. Pictured above is the "Brown Stewed Red Snapper". My fish was NOT CLEANED AT ALL! all the innards were still in tack. Also The fish smelled and tasted VERY fishy. Along with that, the brown stew tasted like a thick barbecue sauce. I called the restaurant to complain, however they were closed. Absolutely horrible customer service. They gave me a very small amount of chicken so when I asked for a little more they tried to change me double. Before I finished explaining the toppings I wanted the lady already began wrapping my sandwich and gave ME attitude when I explained that I wasn\'t finished... so confused. When I thought the situation couldn\'t get any worse, as I was about to pay I asked for a cup for water and they explained that they were all out of cups. But when I saw there were plenty of cups available they said they couldn\'t give me those cups and that there would be more tomorrow?!! Then as I sat to eat with my girlfriend the lady continues to just stare at us while speaking whatever language they spoke, it all just felt very demeaning and unprofessional. When I asked for more napkins later as we were finishing the meal the man came over and continued to ask what the situation was and if I needed more napkins in a sarcastic tone. Dude, just please stop talking, and give me my napkins. Absolutely ruined my experience at subway here on campus and will never be returning. We had a really good experience and enjoyed the new turkey sandwich (it was California turkey something). The staff was so kind! Don\'t even want to give them 1 star. They don\'t deserve it. The customer service is TERRIBLE. They don\'t even ask which type of bread you want for your sandwich, gives you the smallest amount of meat, and doesn\'t give all the proper toppings/sauces that are supposed to come with the sandwich. NEVER EVER GOING HERE AGAIN. Please do yourself a favor. Don\'t go here and waste your money. Some real attitude in here. Plus, half the staff doesn\'t wear a mask, they don\'t even pretend. I had "thought" that businesses on campus were under the same mandate as the students. I guess not? Are they vaccinated? This was the worst Subway sandwich I\'ve ever had. It was flimsy, no choices offered! Paid over $20 dollars with all the fees included with Grubhub. I will never order again! Horrible. Don\'t go. The person was talking on the phone the entire time when making the sandwich. At check-out, she asked if I wanted a drink, I said no. I asked her for the receipt and she still charged me for the drink. When I confronted her, she gave me a smirk and handed me a cup. No shame at all. They should close this place down. With this kind of moral standard, I can only imagine what they do with the food. Our waitress was great. Food was probably a 3.5. We ordered the chicken ranch sandwich. The atmosphere was a 0. Sat there with my wife and daughter listening to some white guy at the bar getting berated for at t least 15 minutes (when we were done) about how bad white people are etc.  what a freaking joke of a place. Our first impression of Philly did not disappoint. "City of brotherly love" my ass. One of the worst buffets I have ever been to.\n\nWent to this place on a Saturday afternoon to grab lunch and was absolutely  dissatisfied with the food.\n\nFood looked old and tasted the way or looked.\nUnfortunately I took a few bites but that was enough for me, paid for the Pepsi and left. I will never go here again.\n\nBeware ! Worst of the worst. Food tasted stale, previously frozen, low end quality. Felt really gross after eating. I wish I can say "you get what you pay for" but this was even less than the cheap price we paid. You know, how they say, if you don\'t find people of a certain ethnicity eating in an ethnic specific restaurant, that\'s usually a "bad thing". So true with this one.

The waiter was RUDE and at one point yelled at my friend who asked for more soda, saying "don\'t you see I\'m busy and don\'t have time for this right now". \nUnprofessional and mediocre place. Not coming back. We went to this Resturant the food isn\'t good at all. Sushi rice was so hard n it wasn\'t fresh. Their wasn\'t enough variety selection. I would give zero star! Our money we spend on this Resturant was wasted! Food is Awful!!!! Never go here again!!!!! This is about the third Oriental buffet to occupy this space.  They seem to go further and further downhill with each iteration.  Don\'t get me wrong. For six bucks, you can find SOMETHING to eat here, whether it\'s baked fish or fried chicken wings that will be worth the small price.\n\nHowever, once upon a time, you could count on going to the sushi station and finding some relatively fresh, simple nigiri.  Eeel, shrimp, salmon, tuna etc.  Now at dead noon, you will find nothing but the cheapest rolls, NO nigiri, and the trays maybe 1/4 populated and not being replenished,\n\nThe "Mongolian Barbecue" likewise, has been pared down to chicken or fake crabmeat.. not even gristly beef or cocktail shrimp.\n\nWaitstaff does not know the meaning of "unsweetened" ice tea in English.\n\nTemperatures of many of the foods are kind of scary.  Not a place I would really trust the raw clams.\n\nIt\'s a shame, because Oriental buffets with AYCE sushi are a guilty pleasure for me. This one is really close to my home, but I gave them three chances since the Grand Opening, and they have gone downhill progressively each time.  I guess I\'ll have to wait for the fifth iteration.  Sometimes I wonder if they are really new owners, or if they just go under and re-open with a new name. Dude. I just got yelled at for trying to bring my ice cream cone out. It was one cone, what the hell. I get the whole don\'t take out food but it\'s not like I wasn\'t eating it or trying to sneak it out to anyone. \n\nSimply stated, customer service here is terrible. I had to walk up to the waitress to ask for my one and only water refill. I was Very disappointed in the food, (it was dried out) and they no longer serve crab legs! The cocktail sauce was mixed with something sweet! It Tasted like jelly!!No lie, as a mom of a diabetic child, I knew something was up when my daughter started wolfing down the cocktail sauce! Telling me it was and I quote,  So Good! When I tried to bring this to certain staffs attention,  then No one understood English! I was Not trying to get my money back. Just letting them know that how dangerous this can be for someone who has diabetes. If they don\'t have the ingredients for proper cocktail sauce don\'t add jelly to it to make it last!! Also the bathroom was dirty too! We were in the mood for cheap Chinese buffet and decided to give this place a chance despite the 2.5 ratings.\n\nFirst off, this place isn\'t cheap for a cheap Chinese buffet. Its 13 dollars for dinner. Secondly, it says free drink refills on the menu but it actually is not. Thirdly, we thought itd be worth it because they have a sushi station, but that was deceiving because we went early and there were still only about 6 pieces left. Basicslly, this place has your standard 8$ buffet food for $13. Visited three times. I enjoyed a variety of seafood here. Recently moving from the Bay Area, I was also surprised to find some quite authentic Chinese food. Surely my favorite in Philadelphia. Typical Chinese buffet, really. Despite getting there around 30 minutes after opening, some of the food looked like it had been sitting out for quite a while- sensitive things like fish, raw meat for stir frying, etc. The stir fry/hibachi I had did not have much flavour, despite asking for garlic and some type of sauce. Again, the meat for the hibachi had been sitting out too long- the beef was jerky-dry.\n\nThe sushi seemed to be pretty fresh, however, and it was replaced a couple times during the hour or so that our party of 10 was there. If you have a party over 8, you will be split into two tables, so note that when bringing a group.\n\nTheir desserts looked well put together, but I opted for fruit. Much of it was canned, but the fresh fruit was sliced recently, so no complaints there. \n\nAll in all, the food sitting out as long as it did was not very comforting, and many of the dishes tasted like it, too. The things that were inviting did taste good, however. Not blown away, but good enough for jazz. Food: \nBad, really bad.( As a Asian food lover, I think their food taste like some bad quality food truck.)\nand not many choice for the food.\n\nService:***\nThe waitress are ok. But ***Watch out*** they may count more tax on your bill. They did count more tax on our bill. I never have this kind of experience before. I don\'t really care about that few bucks, but it really made my friends and I feel angry because of their not honesty.\n\nAmbience:\nNormal Chinese restaurant. It is still clean because they just opened few months.\n\n\np.s. I won\'t go there anymore. :( bad experience and food. God bless. My boyfriend was robbed here after a problem ordeal trying to fix their mistakes on an online order. We filed a police report. Long waits, incorrect order, sloppy packaging and rude staff. I didn\'t even eat my food I got here. Skip this place and save yourself on a lot of unneeded frustration! Was an enjoyable surprise. Do not have any close to me. I enjoyed the red skinned potatoes and a meatloaf carver sandwich. Very tasty. Restaurant was clean, food was fresh. A good visit I was verbally harassed by some heroin addicted panhandlers on my way to the entrance.\n\nStaff looked unhappy, bored and disinterested.  \n\nThe line was disorderly filled parents who don\'t know how to control their kids in public.  \n\nTables were dirty. \n\nThe food was cold.  The chicken was slimey and the portions seemed very small considering \nthe quality.  \n\nI wasn\'t expecting a five star restaurant, but this was really a pitiful experience.\n\nOverall, not the experience I remember from other Boston Market locations in the past.\n\nI won\'t be back. I arrived here at 8pm on a Sunday. They didn\'t have any ready chicken yet. The wait for a ready chicken was 30minutes. They close at 9pm, and they started cleaning everything at 8pm. While me and 5 other people were waiting for chicken, or any other meat which they didn\'t have. STAY AWAY! Takes forever and is gross.\n\nThe order finally arrived after more than two hours (after 45 minutes they said it was "out for delivery") and then it had plastic wrapping stuck in the sandwich. The service is horrible! I ordered my steak rare and it arrived well done each time!!  You are charged extra for the rate option yet it is never delivered!  Today, I ordered breakfast and was not notified until I called1/2 hour after it was supposed to be delivered that they had no steak available!  This was my last order for this place!! It took them 1.5 hours to get here but they are the only people who seem to deliver breakfast on a Sunday morning.  That\'s fine.\n\nWhat wasn\'t fine was the one (or two?) egg omelette wedged between two floppy and cold pieces of wonderbread.  I literally laughed out loud and said: "are you kidding me?" to my co-eater (who had the much more acceptable-looking chicken salad that was described as "not the worst".)\n\nWas I being unreasonable to expect something a bit more robust from spiro\'s "BIG BREAKFAST SANDWICH" at $5.25?\n\nI feel sad now. i ordered delivery, live a mile away, and waited TWO HOURS for a cold, soggy omelet, and some "home fries with cheese" that had practically NO CHEESE. never ordering from here again! i\'ve ordered from here once before, and it was been marginal--at best!--then, too, but TWO HOURS for some bad food is ridiculous!  i could\'ve cooked something WAY better and WAY faster if it wasn\'t so cold out and had gone grocery shopping.  this food is NOT worth the wait! The food was very good and the service by Frances was great. Nice place to sit. Very homey and welcoming. Ordered delivery. Never received order after 2 hours. Would not recommend\n\nEDIT: Received order over an hour late, was cold. What should have been crisp was soggy, and what should have been hot was not. Glad it came eventually, but wish it was delivered hot. Do NOT order from Spiros.  They are guaranteed to (a) get your order wrong (b) simply leave off major items from your order but still charge your credit card and (c) show up with the aforementioned wrong and missing items in double the delivery estimate (as estimated by foodler).  The two times I\'ve ordered from them (because they open early and I was hungry) they made all three of these errors EACH time.  Never again I ordered delivery from here recently. My food arrived over an hour late, and they only offered me a 10% discount for my "inconvenience." My first experience ordering breakfast.  Well I was all excited that a place would deliver to my office, but the order was not correct.  What it list on line that you get with your order does not come with your order.  I ordered two egg platters, one with two poached eggs -recieved three poached eggs no toast.  The other platter recieved no toast either.  Then recieved two breakfast sandwiches instead of one...maybe they should check the menu for what is supposed to be with the order.  Honestly they gave more than they should and did not include what they should have.  I may give it one more try to see if it was just an off day....to be continued...well i opened my poached eggs they were all boiled hard..maybe i will trust them wiht a bagel in the future?? I haven\'t eaten here yet, but, their bar seems okay. I stopped in  to grab some beer-to-go as my fiance forgot to grab vodka for juice that was already in fridge and it was like 11 at night. Ballsacks...\n\nEven though it was Saturday, it was pretty dead and the bartender, a female, even asked if we were cops. I did get two St. Ides 40\'s for like $8, though. Not bad for beer at nearly 9% ABV a pop. Not a spot I\'d go and hang out, but, it did its job. Horrible Horrible HORRIBLE service. Food took almost TWO HOURS TO COME when I am only 10 blocks away from the restaurant. Received a call from the delivery person and they were at the wrong house on the other side of town.\nWhen it arrived at my house the delivery person had NO CHANGE. Only two twenties and $7 in ones. I declined the food. NEVER ORDER FROM HERE. I have ordered from here before and each time I look at the 2 star rating and think "I\'m getting X, which is easy and won\'t cause a problem" and yet every time, no matter what I get, there is a problem. Usually with the delivery but also with the food at times. Not only was the delivery late but the delivery person was rude and on the phone so it took her an additional 10 minutes from when she called me to get me the food. Ridiculous. Will never order from here again. The delivery was surprisingly prompt. Meal was delivered in under 30 mins. I had ordered a Deluxe cheeseburger which is different from a cheeseburger as additionally they provide french fries and onion rings. Both the items were missing. The burger was ok nothing special. Disappointed. In short late service, mediocre food, and horrible hospitality.\n\nIf I could give this restaurant less than one star I 100% would. I ordered food at 10:30 on a Sunday. I expected the food to take a bit of time due to it being Sunday. But I did not expect my food to be THREE HOURS LATE! After waiting the first hour I called and was told the food was on it way. After waiting another hour I called again and was told it was outside. I called and got a refund thankfully. Then when the food did come it wasn\'t even worth what I was paid. I never write reviews but I feel compelled to warn people of the horrible service they could expect from this establishment. I just ordered from Spiro\'s for breakfast delivery, first experience with them. Spoke with two people on the phone, both very nice.\n\nThe food arrived quickly, and was delivered by a nice driver as well.\n\nCoffee better quality than several other places in a two block radius. Orange juice brand Everfresh, radically better than brand Langers served by other nearby breakfast delivery place.\n\nI got a fried egg sandwich on rye with cheese and tomato. Tasted great, and for $1.75 that can\'t be beat. Got side order of poached eggs, nicely done. $1.50! I\'m from San Francisco, these prices are amazing to me. Cinnamon French toast, fresh and delicious, just $3.50.\n\nEverything was carefully and conscientiously packed.\n\nI just moved here and my kitchen isn\'t usable yet. \n\nSatisfied, impressed, and ordering again soon, for sure. This is the absolute worst service I have ever experienced in my life!!! And being a college student, I order out fairly often. As soon as I said hello when the delivery guy called, he gave me an instant attitude. He refused to listen to me as I tried to explain the directions for entering my building (which is not at ALL complicated) and then proceeded to hang up on me three times. He asked me questions such as "Am I sure I know where I live" and said "I don\'t have time for this". How do you not have time for your job? After already waiting an hour for my food to get here, I had to wait an additional 15 minutes in order for him to get it right. He proceeded to complain as he was walking through the door. To top it off, my food was barely warm and mediocre at best. If you want good food and good service, STAY AWAY FROM HERE!!\nBy the way, I\'m only giving this place one star because I have to. It doesn\'t deserve any stars. First time and last time coming here for lunch I asked how much for a cheesesteak lunch platter the lady up front shrugged her shoulders and asked how much money I had and if money was a problem..... so I got a cheese steak wich had a soggy roll and onion rings and a can of soda and that came to 13.00 and was not worth it I usually dont like giving a negative review but definitely felt like I was taken advantage of won\'t ever come here again Do yourself a favor and don\'t waste your time. This is Philadelphia, there are tons of other places within a block who aren\'t rude to their customers, deliver on time and with much better food. This place just flat out sucks. SPIROS: \n\nI don\'t even want to give this Resteraunt any stars because it don\'t need any. This Resteraunt has the worst service. I placed my order at 10:58 am (breakfast), it said that the delivery confirmation would be at 11:58 (a whole hour). When 11:58 came I still didn\'t have my food. I contact the Resteraunt and they told me that my food was still being cooked and that it would be another hour and half (what!!!!). I than asked how can I get a refund (question).. The so called manager told me to get a refund the same way I ordered the food. I contact eat24 and told them the situation but never canceled. I than contact the Resteraunt because I wanted to ask what other options can they give me since now I have to wait almost 2 hours for food which was pancakes eggs and grits and a coffee.. They than told me they canceled my order (but wait, why? I never said canceled my order I just asked how can I get a refund) anyway, I than contact eat 24 and told them if my order was canceled and when can I receive my refund.. They said it was never canceled on their end (fishy) anyway, to make a long complicated story short... DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM THEM IF YOU PLAN ON HAVING IT DELIVERED... I SEEN OTHER REVIEWS AND THEY HAD THE SAME ISSUE.. I WOULD ORDER MY FOOD AT THE RESTERAUNT AND WATCH THEM MAKE IT SO YOU WONT HAVE TO WAIT HOURS... FOR THAT REASON I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!! oh yeah, hire new people or call BAR RESCUE!!!!! Ordered breakfast and it was pretty good! It\'s the only place that delivers around here, and that\'s what made my morning great. I ordered breakfast for my wife and I . In the order was 2 coffees . The women at the register asked  "how many creams and sugars". I asked for 6 in total. As my breakfast was put together which added up to $18 I was given 4 creams. I asked for the 2 more I originally requested. The girl reached her hand in the bin and gave me one more . I almost blew my stack ! But posted this review instead. Poor management in that store . One star is too high for this McDonalds.  I\'ve never in my life been to such a crap hole.  Unfortunately I had no choice being that we were on foot and my son only wanted a happy meal.  First off you have to zig zag your way through all the bums and loiterers outside the entrances.  We walked in and were welcomed with a foul odor.  There was one cashier and the line was 8 deep.  No one working there seemed to care.  The workers were busy chatting up a storm as the line grew longer.  About 15 minutes later we finally ordered.  We had to wait another 8 minutes to get the happy meal.  In the mean time we were approached by several bums asking for change.  As we left I realised they forgotten my sons apple juice.  I was not turning back or ever returning to this place.  I stopped at the news stand and got him his juice.  What a shame.  I\'ve been to other McDonalds in bad neighbourhoods but this one is the worst one by far.  Where is the regional manager of this franchise?\n\n\nSteer Clear of this place at all costs. I have no problem treating McDonald\'s for what it is. I don\'t go to one expecting the guy making the food to have a Michelin Star and I won\'t review it like one. That being said, this place is terrible even for a McDonald\'s. It\'s unfortunate that this establishment is crippled primarily by its clientele which consists of a strange contrast of vagrants and drunken rich kids from Penn with a stick up their posterior. I actually prefer the Vagrants, they don\'t try to drunkenly pick fights because they\'re too wasted to notice that that person was standing in front of them for ten minutes and didn\'t cut in front of them. Said snot-nosed brats are the same reason they have to limit the menu late at night. It\'s dirty, because for some reason going to Penn means you don\'t have to pick up your trash. The types out front late at night can be suspect, even though PPD and campus security is legion in the area. Staff can be pretty curt, bordering on rude, which is almost understandable given they spend most of their time cattle-caring and cleaning up after overgrown children. All in all, it\'s not really worth the time to go here, even if it is 2 AM and you\'re starving.\n\nAnd yes, the guy you just tried to pick a fight with who turned out to be your Orgo lab TA will still be mad even after you\'ve sobered up and written a 2 page E-Mail trying to apologize. Probably one of the worst McDonald\'s I have been to. My order came out wrong, so I took it back to get it fixed - the person working at that time looked straight at me and said simply stated, "oh well". To be quite honest, I don\'t expect five star service at a McDonald\'s; however, I do expect there to be some decent service to the point where I can fix an order gone wrong. So to get a response as such, it really did bother me. Pros: Good location, relatively safe even late at night, accepts coupons, cheap food.\nCon: 9 out of 10 times you go there you\'ll see some little kid being smacked upside the head by an easily frustrated "parent". It\'s almost as bad as SEPTA! Let\'s just say unless youre planning on becoming the next American chess star, steer clear Since this is a McDonald\'s, I went in with low expectations, but this place still managed to fall short of this low bar. I ordered a chicken sandwich with no mayo. I had to wait 20+ minutes for the sandwich. When it finally arrived, sure enough, my sandwich was slathered in mayo. When I informed the cashier of her mistake, she replied curtly that I hadn\'t said no mayo. Of course, I had. After another 10+ minutes of waiting, I finally had my sandwich. So much for fast food.\n\nThis place is almost always filled with either hoodrats or drunk Penn kids. Stay away. YEAAAAAA this place is littt. Only thing is, I would say about 76% of the time the "ice cream machine" aka flurry machine is broken. It has ruined my night multiple times. But other than that, such good food. It\'s also really healthy for you so its a win, win. It is a little expensive though\n\nP.S. the wall deco is impeccable and the workers are cute Went here out of desperation.  Pulled up to see a group of skateboarders and smelly homeless people.  Decided to leave my hungry bunch in the car as I ventured inside.  The place smells but is not a surprise because of the clientele that walk aimlessly about.  The service wasn\'t that bad despite the fact that there seemed to be only 3 people working and one of them was in the seating area sweeping the floors and the tables.  Yes I said tables.  If I knew the area better probably would\'ve looked for someplace else. Pros: Somewhat clean, friendly staff , solid location if you are by campus, most importantly eating 60 chicken nuggets in one sitting didn\'t kill me. \n\nCons: long lines, people outside can be suspect depending on what time of the day. University City McDonald\'s 40th & Walnut. Horrible... Horrible.... Horrible. Their frappe machine is always down. I went on Friday it wasn\'t working, I went again the following Monday, it still isn\'t working. This happens all of the time. Also, they have a bad habit of not having pennies in their registers, so if they owe you 4 cents, they will say "oh sorry I do not have any pennies in my register". Instead of giving you a nickel, they would rather short you and keep your changes. At first it didn\'t bother me, then I thought, how many people are they doing this too they are making extra money doing this. Picture yourself 5 years out of college, on a college campus, after a 3 hour open bar happy hour. You are going to be starving. It is 10:30, sorority girls doing their grocery shopping, and you are salivating at the thought of Bobby\'s Burger Palace. But it is closed. That\'s fine, Chipotle is next door. But that is closed too. Fine fine, we will get Jimmy John\'s. Wait, they don\'t toast their subs, don\'t want it. Finally, we see a golden arch peaking out around the corner. What is it? What is it? It is the one and only Mickey D\'s!\n\nThis McDonalds is bringing in 4 stars for a few reasons. Reliability. It is open when I want it. Cleanliness. Beer goggles didn\'t prevent me from noticing this city McDonalds was recently cleaned. Personality. There were 3 ladies working behind the counter that either loved picking on drunk guys or just had good personality. Overall, the two cheeseburger meal saved the night!\n\nRonald McDonald greater than Bobby Flay ok. I was emotional abused when I went to this restaurant tonight. I had the worst day ever and all I wanted was a McFLurry! Well guess what, the machine was broken (classic) and they also were out of Buttermilk chicken nuggets, even though they have 50 ads for them all around the store. Then they yelled at us to sit on the weird side of the restaurant (the right side) and to top it off, they were out of ketchup. This visit to McDonalds only contributed to my already crippling depression. Not pleased. The last time I came here, I\'m pretty sure they made my iced coffee with sweet tea.  The time before that, they forgot my order for like 15min and then forgot to put sugar in my iced coffee.  The time before THAT, they didn\'t put cream (or whatever the fake cream is) in it.\n\nI\'m not ashamed to admit I visit McD\'s from time to time and I don\'t expect fine dining.  But this place is bad even by the chain\'s standards.  Also, it smells like poo.  There, I said it. So I come into this McDonald\'s because I\'m in love with the surrounding neighborhood. Boy did I make a mistake. My goal was to save money and instead I got a taste of something sour that university city has to offer. First off there was crap dripping off the ceiling but no one seemed to care even though it was in several areas. Second, the cashier\'s were horsing around too much to realize they had two sizable lines. Third, this place is stingy with food utensils. Who eats a salad with their fingers. And now for the dealbreaker there was a loud mouth pimp in there with his junkie lady friends. The staff couldn\'t even ask them to leave. I guess it was because there were some people outside waiting to have a word with the pimp and junkies. It\'s pretty bad. Really, what do you expect, greatness? You won\'t get it, though you will get soggy fries and the typical Big Mac.\n\nFrom what I hear, they would tear this place down to make room for new development, but McDonald\'s doesn\'t allow it. \n\nBurger King across the street was shown the door, why can\'t McDonald\'s get the hint? Fast service when you go at the right times. A lot of homeless people around that area and inside. Little smelly sometimes. Lots of drunk college kids at late hours It\'s ghetto.  $40,000 a year genius wharton students within feet, yet this particular establishment boasts probably some of the poorest service and worst quality people in the state as its frequently quitting employees.  Will they acknowledge you in line? unlikely.  It\'s probably their last shift before walking out. Slow unacknowledging Drake and autotuned rap listening, so good luck getting to see the start of your movie.  It\'s 15-30 minutes for a cheeseburger at this S Show. Ordered an Egg McMuffin, coke and asked if they have carbonated water (I like to dilute my coke so it\'s a bit less sugary).  Both the lady taking my order and manager gave me dagger stares and answered me like I was crazy.\n\nSo, I waited 10 minutes while every other guest was served plus everyone who walked in after me.  The manager reached up and deleted an egg McMuffin from the order list (which I later guessed was mine).  \n\nAfter another few minutes, I walked to the register and asked if there was a problem with my order and a refund.  Although I did get my money back, I got no response about whether there was a problem with my order and no apology.  Just more dagger stares and silence.\n\nApparently, the lesson here is don\'t EVER ask a question.  Of better yet, spend your money elsewhere. ZERO Stars for what we referred to as McDEATH when i was a grad student at Penn.  There have been shootings, stabbiong, roberroes and muggings here over the many years.\n\nYet somehow - McDeath remains open.\n\nLet\'s not even talk about the "hood" demographic servers and patrons alike.\n\nAnd of course the scads of loiterers and homeless, down & out West Philly types.\n\nAVOID.  AVOID. nothing can satisfy my tummy after some drunken debauchery at Smoke\'s like mickey D\'s on 40th and walnut.  the characters you meet there make your experience all the better.  I WILL MISS YOU MCDONALDS.\n\n-Penn Senior Stepped in for a McGriddle (I know, I know, but it was later in the AM and hot breakfast options were scarce) and turned right back around because of the stomach-turning stench.  Either they need to do a much better job cleaning or do something about making sure that only customers are sitting in the lobby. This place is much improved from how it was before the new management took over about a year ago. That being said, if the souplines of the 1930s were to have a modern equivalent, they would be this McDonald\'s. I\'ve personally been repeatedly panhandled in the store. Someone fired a gun in the store a few months ago. The speed of the service is slower than average. (Then again, it seems like pretty much every Philadelphia fast food establishment is a bit on the pokey side.) If you have some sort of coupon or discount, expect to wait a good six minutes for the cashier to find the manager. Waiting that long made me wish I hadn\'t asked for ten cents off.\n\nI\'ve got to say the worst thing that\'s happened here has been when I have ordered soft serve. These guys are perfectionists! They will pour me a cone, decide that it isn\'t perfectly shaped, open the top of the soft serve machine, dump the ice cream back into it, and then pour me the cone again! In addition to being a potential health code violation, this sure makes it take a long time for me to get my cone! (This has happened more than once.) Ok first, I don\'t think this place deserves just one star. It\'s not THAT bad, even though there are people who love to shit on this location. But it also certainly doesn\'t deserve more than 2 stars.\n\nYou may be asking yourself why the heck this guy is reviewing a McDonald\'s. It\'s mainly to point out how bad this place is compared to other McD I\'ve been to.\n\nFirst, the environment is pretty smelly upon entering. Seriously. There\'s some perpetual stink to the place that I can\'t (and don\'t want) put a finger on. \n\nEnvironment: 1/5\n\nThe food is pretty typical except that there\'s some feel of dirtiness because the air is kinda stinky. Also, one time I ordered two salads with chicken, and I literally got the amount of lettuce of 1 salad, split into two bowls and with an extra piece of chicken. \n\nFood: 2/5\n\nGood for late-night snacking as always, however, as would be expected of any Mcd.\n\nGo to Jimmy John\'s instead, unless you\'re craving something super oily at night. Occasionally I like to treat myself to a nice 2 for $5 sausage egg mcmuffin with 3 hashbrowns on the side. A McDonalds here is the same as the McDonalds there, but the quality of the service differs in each location. \n\nI usually come here in the early mornings to grab breakfast and service is quite fast. They handle a hefty amount of customers everyday, from students to homeless people begging, to more students drunk at night after partying. \n\nOne time they said it\'ll take a few minutes to prepare my hashbrowns so they offered to give me a free large Freshly Squeezed orange juice drink! (I only say freshly squeezed because thats what it says on the machine). \n\nIt was the manager of the morning shift who had given me this treat. She\'s so kind :) DO NOT GO HERE. Especially at night. besides the drug addicts falling over all of the tables, the employees are RUDE, INCOMPETENT, SLOW and SASSY (not in a good way). the milkshake machine never works and it takes forever to get your food. in addition, the restaurant is very dirty and you typically have to pay extra for many condiments (like honey mustard). ok, it\'s mcdonalds. we all get that. it\'s not so much the restaurant as the staff. i am very impressed by their courtesy and attention to detail. if you need mcd\'s after a night out, these folks will hook you up and treat you well. Andy is right. this has to be the worst mcdonalds ever.  i will not deny that i am one of the few people left in the world who actually enjoys mcdonalds, but this particular one is just awful.\n\nfrom the homeless people pestering you nonstop, to shadiness going on in the bathrooms, combined with the fact that it takes the workers there about 20 minutes to give you your meal, makes this mcdonalds one to avoid.\n\non my last trip there, i saw a lady changing her infant son\'s crappy diaper on one of the tables. The wait was  way longer than I have ever experienced at a McDonald\'s. Took about 10 minutes to get a burger and fries. The burger was only warm, the fries were hot. Everyone seemed to move really slowly. \n\nThe staff was in full swearing  mode tonight. The guy cleaning the floor was tossing F-bombs every few seconds. Half the clientele appeared to be homeless. Panhandling seems to be  allowed in the restaurant. Even the cashier was asking for tips. \n\nOK, it was  an interesting McDonald\'s but I don\'t  think I would come here on a regular  basis. I used to have a silly mustache.  It was long and thin (extending about 4 inches or so into the air).  I had it for three years.  I used it as a prop for my pro wrestling habit.\n\nOne time, while in the area, I decided to stop into this McDonald\'s.  I waited in line until it was my turn to speak to the girl at the counter.\n\nPerhaps she had never seen a mustache before.  It must have been something new for her, as she immediately began to laugh in my face over it.\n\nNow, wearing a ridiculous stache like that, you have to take the reactions with a grain of salt.  I knew this.  It didn\'t bother me.  I was used to it.\n\nExcept, this girl started to laugh uncontrollably at me.  In fact, so much so that she wouldn\'t take my order.  Instead, she called over a large group of McDonald\'s workers to look at me... all the while pointing at me and wetting themselves with glee and cackling.  Much like at the circus.  Much like the pack of hyenas in The Lion King.\n\nEven so, it wouldn\'t have been so horrible.  Except it wasn\'t a HA HA I\'m with you on the joke.  It was malicious laughing.  Belittling laughing.\n\nYou can imagine all the ignorant, ghetto trash things they said to me.  Let\'s face it.  They WERE ghetto trash, and they worked in McDonald\'s in Philadelphia.  This isn\'t an indication of race or socioeconomic status -- just a statement on our town. \n\nOf all the travesties of manners and customer service I\'ve endured in Philly fast food establishments, this experience was perhaps the most damning and indicative of the type of slugs that inhabit this city\'s minimum wage workforce. Pros: Food tasted as it should... which isn\'t really a pro because we should come to expect that from any restaurant, especially a chain. The staff was friendly and it\'s close to campus.\n\nCons: This McDonald\'s looks like it hasn\'t been renovated since the early 90\'s and is in a bit of a disconnect with the rebranding McDonald\'s is trying to implement. The tables were dirty, the manager stood around when he should\'ve take initiative to clean tables, open up an extra cash register, or done something to increase customer experience. Pros:. It\'s 24/7 so you can get your McDonald\'s cravings. \n\nCons: Their service is fairly poor. The cashier may mess up your order or their queue process will get backed up. Also, for some reason, there is a high traffic of homeless people, which is fine, but it gets to be difficult to eat if you are approached several times in a night. It happened to my friends and I. There were three of us; three different people approached to ask for food. After my son opened his kids meal, we realized his milk was expired after he drank some. I showed it to an employee and she checked their milk bottles. They were all expired. We were offered no refund or even an apology. The other milk was not even removed from the fridge. I waited a very long line for the drive-through for a Diet Coke and a medium french fry I didn\'t open the bag until I got home my fries were barely halfway full. This is the place to go when you\'re drunk out of your mind. The service, cleanliness, and food is far below even the most  sub-par of places to eat in west philly. However, it does the trick if you\'re drunk and in need of a quick hunger fix. Otherwise, avoid this pile like the plague. Penn should try harder to get rid of this place. Pros: it is open 24/7, so it is a savior when those late night cravings hit.\nCons: it\'s a toss up whether you get super stale soggy fries or not, and food is mediocre.\n\nOverall, does its job serving up greasy fast food. This is strictly for the girl Heather who waited on me the other night.  The place was full of drunks and losers and she still was the most sweet, pleasant, and helpful person.  I can\'t say I would have been the same way so kudos to Heather for providing great customer service under crappy working conditions. I\'m a big fan of McDonald\'s but This place is a piece of bullshit. Within a week, the system was down for at least once (therefore no transactions) and ice cream machine was "not working" for at least another time. Save yourself some headache and go somewhere else. Wow, first time I walked in here and was hit by a disgusting smell.... I still cringe today every time I walk in. Apparently it\'s whatever their cleaner is, mixed with the smell of a college student\'s vomit on the floor (which happens all too often, if the rolling of the staff\'s eyes is to be taken into account). I really do feel sorry for them to have to clean up after the mess students make, the local residents are much better about policing their trash.\n\nSpeed is efficient and one of the first McDonald\'s I had seen with the LCD menus back in 2002-ish?\n\nThere\'s a drive-thru? :P\n\nBut the Burger King that was removed in favor of the restaurant/Bridge combination across the street was sad, and this is the only thing left really from my initial view of this intersection in 1998... aside from the old Public Library.\n\nAs for safety, it\'s considerably improved from 10 years ago, I would say. There are fewer bums and fewer shady characters as that\'s been pushed away and further out by the gentrification of the area. Most of the worry now comes from the north, near Market & 40th. Gotta say, this place is stepping it up. I suppose they finally realized that given their location they should be doing about $150,000,000 in business a day, and that they would be if the place wasn\'t such a colossal wreck. Went in the other day, late(ish) at night and was greeted by a vagrant and (fall-down) drunk student free environment that was reasonably clean. They seem to be in the habit of hiring private security to keep the squatters and homeless out of the place NOW. They have new electronic screen menus, buzzer order-calling system, and a much better attitude. This McDonalds always smells bad...makes you loose your appetite...food takes very long and majority of the workers have attitudes. This McDonald\'s, like the rest of the chain, is nothing special. The customer service is barely up to par and it\'s always crowded, due to its location. Half the time, it\'s messy. Ketchup and napkins everywhere, tables are greasy, etc. Again, this isn\'t different than any of the the other McDonald\'s around. I have been to many a McDonalds in my life, and this one is by far the worst. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the smell. It\'s a combination of stale BO, cheap floor cleaner and grease. It\'s terrible. \n\nThe second thing you tend to notice is the clientele. It\'s like every bum and "people of Walmart" type person in university city. \n\nThe food is terrible (even by McD\'s golden standards), the restaurant is incredibly dirty, the bathroom is unusable. If you do decide to go here, lord help you. Check your bag before you leave because you will probably have been given the wrong items. Also probably wash your hands. While affectionately called McDeath by many West Philadelphians, this McDonald\'s might deserve a little more leeway, in my opinion. People that take the time to write reviews on Yelp are not likely to be people that frequent McDonald\'s (myself included). If you love food enough to write detailed reviews then in all likelihood, you love food too much to settle for a Micky D\'s cheeseburger. \n\nPretension is a vice of the highest order, and I am typically loathe to accept the kind of rhetoric that often gets thrown around art and food culture. There\'s a season for all things, and while your local art gallery may not have the kind of displays you can find at the Barnes, it doesn\'t mean it\'s unworthy of a visit. To my mind, the same is true of restaurants. There\'s a time and a place for a visit to Qdoba or especially, the local food truck. For a late night McFlurry, what better than the McDonald\'s on Walnut and 40th? \n\nDespite certain enjoyable oddities - the Coltrane jazz over the loudspeakers, for instance - this McDonald\'s location is certainly subpar. As one reviewer stated, it may be in need of a mulligan, or at the very least, an upgrade. Even the usually standardized quality of the food is subpar (allow me a whiny moment: I ordered a Reese\'s McFlurry and the thing was unmixed, just a sprinkling of peanut butter pieces on top). That\'s not a McFlurry; that\'s soft-serve with an accidental spill of crunched-up Reese\'s. FYI: there\'s a Ben & Jerry\'s right around the corner. Usually slow service even when there aren\'t too many people. Best come here when drunk or you\'re gonna have a bad time. Fries are good but they don\'t give you as much as other McDonald restaurants. Homeless people are always visible outside during the day but otherwise it\'s just like any other McDonalds. Hahahaha... so happy to see these other 2 reviews! This has absolutely got to be the shittiest McDonald\'s on the planet. The drive-thru people yell at you, then ask you to pull over and wait for your food. After 15 minutes I finally backed into the drive-thru line again and blocked everyone from getting their food until they gave me mine. Everyone was honking and screaming and I thought I was going to get shot... what a rush! As mentioned, it is more of a homeless shelter than anything. "Alright, McGriddle!"\n\nI looked up this McDonald\'s specifically because most of my other reviews are all positive, so I thought to myself "What is the absolutely worst place in Philly I have been to?" This is my answer. I just ordered food from these sorry asses and it is disgusting.  I\'m almost convinced it\'s mystery meat in their food.  Don\'t believe the Grubhub ratings.  They are almost always wrong.  I mean how do you make fried rice and it\'s almost white?  It\'s tasteless food.  Never ordering from there again. I love this place. The food is always good and I never have to wait long for it to be delivered. I love the peach home made tea. Considering I\'ve had some very disappointing experiences with the many other Chinese restaurants since moving here. I\'m really surprised with their low rating,  but I\'m good Ordered takeout. Every single item was dripping grease, tasteless, over-salted and disgusting! Egg Foo Yong was grease sponges and glutinous glop. General tso\'s chicken was grease sponges in sugar syrup. The 2 soggy globs of broccoli were a pathetic nod to the vegetable persuasion. Yuk. My husband and I have tried three other local places and none of them have been very good. This place has really saved the day. The egg roll was perfect (not greasy at all, despite what the other review here says). The Kung Pao chicken had a nice flavor and a perfect amount of heat. Will definitely be ordering from here again. Worst restaurant ever. My boyfriend and I were impressed initially by the menu. Then the food arrived and it was absolutely revolting. Please see my picture of the "keylime" pie. It was rancid and I nearly dropped dead from the smell. The rest of the food was undercooked, greasy, no flavor and you could tell that no effort had been put into creating this meal. Save your money! The pizza is just ehh... I should have just ordered from stogies..The girl on the phone was short and rude on the phone. The buffalo shrimp had little to no buffalo sauce on them and they were made of mostly breading. This place should cut the menu down and focus on perfecting each menu item. Quality over quantity. Possibly hire someone with personality to answer the phones. One of the more decent pizza shops in South Philly.  I\'ve been numerous times. Probably the worst pizza I have ever eaten was from here. I\'m not even sure how they have been in business for so long. The pizza I ordered somehow has a water spot the size of a fist. I\'m not even sure how that is possible if you put the pizza into the oven. They must have rushed the order and not even bakes the pizza for the correct amount of time. I\'m not sure as I had the pizza delivered but the sauce was so watery that we were unable to eat it and threw it out. I don\'t not recommend this place at all. Will not disappoint. I have been ordering from these guys for the past 8 months now, and have been amazed every time. Their homemade rolls are amazing! Cheesesteaks and hoagies. They also have really good pasta dinners. Excellent customer service. Cheesesteak was great. Driver was very friendly as was the staff when I called in. I had an issue with the delivery because my hotel has a bad address and I gave them the wrong phone number by accident. When I called in asking about the delivery they kindly explained they attempted to make the delivery and couldn\'t reach me. They came back out very quickly without any complaints. Very professional and courteous. I\'m from Georgia so I have not tried all the local cheesesteaks, but this had a great flavor and wasn\'t too greasy. Highly recommended. Absolute worse place I\'ve ever eaten. My turkey burger was bland and straight out the deep freezer, my fries were the same. I fed it to my dog. But before that i called them to get something else or my refund. The manager said it was my fault I ordered my burger well done and I should\'ve asked for seasoning on my fries. WTF? I didn\'t know well done equated to dry and disgusting. They run their business very poorly and I will never eat here again. I have to say "I\'ve always enjoyed their foods." Never had a compliant. They cook your food just the way you order it. My favorite is the cheese steak grinder with provolone cheese and fried onions. Their cheese fries are also really good. The pizza is ok. The buffalo wings are really good too. Its a great fast food italian take-out. Makes me happy in my tummy. Friendly hometown pizza shop, good food, great prices....I visit at least once a week! Ordered from Wolf Street Pizza without checking the reviews and when it was on it\'s way I was shocked to see that it had such poor reviews on yelp when it was considered top rated on grubhub (maybe grubhub has users that are easier to please?)  My expectations were lowered immensely and I prepared to be waiting for my food for a long time, I almost warmed the oven to have it ready for late cold pizza delivery. However, the pizza arrived in less than 30 minutes. Let\'s start with the Crust. The crust is your standard mass produced pizza crust. You know the kind, it is semi soft, rarely crunchy and has a lattice imprint on the underside of the crust.  The sauce, well, if there is one thing I cannot say about the sauce, is that it\'s bland. This sauce is exploding with flavor. Think of a delicate sanmarzano crushed tomato sauce with a bit of fresh basil and imagine an extremly highly seasoned viscious tomato sauce that is so thick, salted, and spicy that it resembles a marinara sauce. It is packed with flavor... although I don\'t know if it\'s a very desirable flavor. Lastly is the cheese and pepperoni. This is where they messed up. The pepperoni is great, it\'s a nice dark greasy beef pepperoni that curls and crisps on the edges while having a molten pool of rich olive oil in the center. The cheese however is a very low moisture mozzarella with a low fat content, it\'s a very dehydrated cheese and cheaper pizza places will often use it because it has double to triple the shelf life of fresh mozzarella. The problem is that because the sauce is so high in salt and because the cheese is so low in moisture, the liquid released from the cheese upon melting in the oven cannot dilute the salt content from the sauce and the surface stays intact and dehydrated. So the cheese doesn\'t meld into the sauce it forms a raft that slides off the pie when the delivery driver is making right turns on yellow lights. Where if they used a higher fat and higher moisture mozzarella, it would have melted very evenly at a much lower temperature. This is the type of cheese that we see when we see a pizza slice being lifted from the pie and the cheese stretches out off the slice and down to the cheese magma below. What\'s worse is that the cheese they use ends up not just being tightly attached in a raft, but when bite into the cheese it has a bouncy firmness to it that turns very solid when the pizza cools down for a few minutes after you open the box. It\'s a struggle to get a slice of pizza out of the box without all the cheese sliding off or ripping all of the cheese off from the neighbor slices. It\'s not a bad pizza for midnight delivery, but when you have low quality ingredients, save the deliciously perfect pepperoni, you end up with a low quality pizza, and thats exactly what this is. 1 star pizza, 1 star for the pepperoni, and one star for fast delivery! Pizza science, Bitches The food was awful the pizza was burnt and I waited on my pizza for more than 30 mins . They really need to get better pizza makers or something! Not the place that I would want to go back to the place. Short answer: Go elsewhere. \n\nWe tried Wolf Street Pizza for the first time a few weekends ago and the experience and food were both absolutely terrible.  Delivered our order completely wrong, fought with us about the order, never came back with our correct order AND the food was cold.  Over an hour to get two pizzas is ridiculous.  So many better options nearby. While the food was good, I took issue with the pricing. #1-  I placed my order on Foodler.com and received a total I was to pay in cash upon arrival.  Needless to say, the totals did not match when the driver arrived.  The prices on the Foodler website were cheaper than I was actually charged.  If you are going to advertise your food at a certain price then that is what you need to sell it at.  It is not my fault you have not updated your prices.  Unfortunately, this cut into the driver\'s tip because I had exactly enough for the original price.  \n\n#2- I knew there was a .75 delivery charge, and this was added in handwriting at the bottom of the receipt.  However, upon further investigation, I found I had already been charged .40 for delivery through their computer!\n\nSo now I have been overcharged for my food and delivery by about 2 bucks.  No, it\'s not a lot of money, but they blatantly did not honor the posted prices (they even gave me the Foodler receipt with the cheaper prices on it in addition to their inflated receipt!) and then double charged me for delivery.  \n\nCheck your receipts people! Terrible! My girlfriend and I ordered a pizza and wings from here. Took over 2hrs for the food to arrive. When calling to find out where the order is the lady kept saying that the driving is pulling up now and should be outside. 30 minutes goes by and still nothing. Save yourself the hassle and just go to pizzeria pestos! My boyfriend and I were happy with the food here the first time we ordered. The second time we ordered the same exact thing (1 week later) and the food was so terrible I called the restaurant to let them know and offered to return the food which was not touched for our money back. The assistant manager did not accept our return. Then the manager was contacted and told me he couldn\'t refund us because we kept the food. Which I had offered to return multiple times. Then after all that we found what looked like 3 dark curly hairs in one of our pasta dishes. We will never be dining here again If you order pasta, it\'s homemade. And it\'s good. There\'s too much sauce for me, but it\'s still really good. \nNot sure why they received bad reviews, but I like em. \n:)\nAlso had their breakfast (remodeling kitchen) and it was good, quick and they seem nice. \nEat here. Wolf, please do Philadelphians a favor and go out of business. Your pizza and wings are disgustingly soft, cold and bland-- which perfectly matches your service. Save your time and money and order elsewhere. I placed an order today through Eat24 and only received half of what I ordered, and what I did receive was either cold, completely wrong, or had clearly been sitting out under a heat lamp for a long time.  The manager did authorize a full refund to me, but only after several repeated attempts of offering me 25% off my next order from them by the woman that answers the phone.  This is my first and last time ordering from here, but I\'m happy I didn\'t end up getting charged for the bad food I did receive. I\'d give negative stars if I could. Ordered delivery and got an est. delivery time of 1 hr. Well 1 hr came and went so we decided to call and check on our pizza. The restaurant was very rude on the phone and told us it was a few mins away. We waited another hour and tried to contact the restaurant again, when the delivery guy finally arrived. Got the pizza and wings and all of them were straight out-of-the-fridge cold. Tried to contact the restaurant again to complain in the hopes of getting a refund, only to be told that "we should expect late delivery because of the distance." Two and a half hours later, and we\'re still waiting to eat our pizza that\'s currently warming in the oven....\n\nLong story short, this place absolutely sucks. Overpriced small pie. No individual slices. Pizza tasted stale like a day old pizza shoved back in the oven!!! I haven\'t really found a consistent pizza place for delivery until now. \n\nWolf Street not only has excellent pizza (my favorite is the New Yorker specialty pizza) but a wide variety of items on their menu which comes in handy when we have guests or one of us is in the mood for something other than pizza. While their burgers are just ok, they are good for a place that doesn\'t specialize in burgers. \n\nWhat impresses me most is their customer service, even on the most horrid of snowy nights their delivery persons are on time and always have a smile. They always thank me for my business and in today\'s marketplace this is something that is all too often forgotten. These little things are what keeps me coming back again and again. Wolf Street is seriously the best food for solid prices! I have been trying different stuff every time and it\'s been consistently good every time! I love this place and definitely recommend it!  I don\'t understand how their rating is so low on here, because their food is awesome. Try the soup (I\'ve had Clam Chowder and a Tortellini spinach soup so far and they were both great) and the grilled cheese (it\'s on thick cut Texas Toast! I add Bacon and Tomato to mine and it\'s great!) Ordered delivery through grubhub and it was a terrible experience. First off, only half of my order arrived. After talking to both the driver and the restaurant, I was assured that a second driver was "already on the way" with the other part of my order, and that they would be here "very soon". This restaurant is 13 minutes away from me, and I received my order 40 minutes after I had spoken to the restaurant on the phone. Which is 2 hours after I placed my initial order. Then I found that the stromboli was cold and the dough was only halfway cooked in the middle. Grubhub then told me the restaurant would only give me a 20% discount. Which didn\'t even cover the item that was severely delayed, let alone the tax on it or tip that they didn\'t deserve. I don\'t know why this restaurant was rated nicely on grubhub. Don\'t order from here if you value customer service and fully cooked food. Putrid pizza.. could taste NOTHING but salt!!! Had to throw that whole large pizza out! GF\'s gluten-free pizza (with "extra cheese,) needed way more "extra cheese" when it was delivered, fortunately we had some mozzarella at home... Will never order from this est. again. Can\'t fathom why they have positive ratings!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE\n\nFor starters the phone girl has zero personality and is very short with you and rude, second i placed my order today at 12:44, it is now 3:25 and i still have NO food. i had to call them twice and was told both times my food was on its way. i understand busy days especially football Sunday but almost 4 hours for food is insane. i did place the order online and they confirmed they got it but apparently no one ever did anything with the order. i now had to call someone else after waiting this long for food to order from some where else. i will NEVER order from here again. Would have been one star since they forgot part of my order, but two since their sandwich was decent. This place is a joke. "Best Pizza: 1992"...either there was no competition or the pizza vastly different. I just got back with late dinner, and am disgusted. The pricing in the menu doesn\'t match what\'s posted in store, and they won\'t honor the price above the counter. My onion rings were burned, yet soggy. My girlfriend\'s pizza fries taste like they were cooked in a microwave. It\'s easily the worst food I\'ve ever had. I\'ve been currently waiting one hour and 53 minutes for a pizza and salad.  I\'ve called multiple times and have been told it\'s on it\'s way and they tried blaming the delay on the rain that started 45 minutes after I placed my order.  Unacceptable and ridiculous service Love the buffalo wings, lightly breaded, light sauce. Panzarotti is delicious. Only 3 stars until I try more food. Food was not edible. Chicken fingers were burnt and the fries weren\'t cooked. Do NOT order. The delivery times can vary, sometimes it\'s surprisingly quick other times it\'s not. The pizza is good, nothing to write home about but not much to complain about. The dinner salad is kind of lacking but I don\'t expect much from a pizzeria. It usually comes with egg and olive if that\'s your jam. I have ordered from here multiple times and had to write a review. First time I order, I got some outstanding penne vodka and not only was it large but it was outstanding.\n\nSince then I have tried a lot of the menu and have come away generally satisfied. Service is nice and delivery has never been an issue for me. Definitely 5 star based on price quantity quality and a deep menu to choose from. I will continue to keep Wolf Street in my rotation. Ordered food and it took 2 hours to arrive. Called and staff was surly and rude. Said rain was cause for delay, which is ridiculous. Delivery person couldn\'t be bothered to apologize. Food was decent, but certainly not worth the wait. Very clear why this place has only two stars. Definitely recommend ordering from any other place. Just ordered.. the food was here on time and hot.. reasonably priced.. however.. I ordered the cutlet stromboli, which is supposed to come with onions and roasted peppers.. but didn\'t.. it\'s good without.. but not what I ordered. Just like the Pepsi instead of coke that I ordered.. hey.. they nailed the dinner salad. The pizza was delivered without a pizza bag so it was lukewarm by the time we got it. The 2 liter Pepsi was so warm that it was undrinkable. Two stars because the pizza was actually decent, I just wish that they got the temperature of it and the drink right. We ordered a breakfast pizza this morning via GrubHub for delivery to my office. I put a note the order for them to deliver to the lobby. The delivery guy called when he was a few blocks away and asked me to come outside to meet him -- I told him I had instructions on the order to deliver to the backdoor lobby area of the building. He called to say he was outside of the building -- was very rude on the phone both times. I went outside to meet him at his car as requested of him (we gave him exact change due to his attitude) -- he had the nerve to ask for a tip after refusing to follow simple instructions  and to walk to the door!! We order take-out in our building often - people always deliver to our lobby area or office, but not this guy. Plus the pizza has very little bacon (sadly) - it\'s alright, but I\'ll NEVER order again or recommend this place. Most the time the food was good, but lately you call to place your order and a gentleman rushes through your order before you have a chance to tell him exactly what you want to order. I ordered a low carb meal 2 days ago (it should have been chicken, peppers, onions and spinach, my order comes I\'m running my fork through the meal and no spinach is in it, I call Wolf Street back the women that answered the phone ask a gentleman in the background was spinach supposed to be in the platter the gentleman says oh yeah we ran out of spinach, I was then told they would give me a $2.00 discount, never mind my dinner consisted of chicken, peppers and onions. No one called me back to say would you like a salad, or some broccolli they feel you should take whatever they dish out. Friday I order again a cheesesteak with prov and wiz and fried onions, it comes and no prov, call them back again the gentleman says I didn\'t here you say prov (stop rushing and read the customers order back to them) I also ordered hot wings some how my total came to $13.16 and that\'s with the $2.00 disc. My job large fam orders from here and my colleagues, my fraternity also.  And we all agree our money will not continue to go to someone that is rude and slick. Horrible! Almost 2 hours wait for delivery! Food was COLD and gross... Driver forgot our drinks but said he had to go because he was scared he would get a ticket then we asked for our money back for drinks and he said "ugh well I already paid for them" (after we tipped him $6 bc we figured it wasn\'t his fault) when we called about our food taking 2 hours they didn\'t care they told us it\'s because were 20 minutes away (then u shouldn\'t serve this area)  this place is so unprofessional from the person answering the phones to the driver.  If they were apologetic and act like they cared a little but I would\'ve never even complained. Only giving this place one star because zero is not an option. I ordered from this place a few days ago...got a pizza and a drink. The delivery was quick but the driver forgot my drink and gave me someone else\'s when I complained. The pizza tasted ok but made me sick. Should not have ignored the other reviews. Do not eat here unless you want to be sick. We were starving at 11 pm on Saturday, and our regular pizza joint was closed, so we ordered from Wolf Street through GrubHub. I had heard good things. I entered the order around 11 or 11:10, grateful they were still open. The pizza arrived, cold, two hours later at 1:15.\n\nGranted, it was snowing terribly, and the roads were bad. I wasn\'t expecting perfection or super-fast delivery. But I say, if you can\'t make your deliveries, don\'t take orders. I don\'t know if the fault is with Wolf Street or Grub Hub.\n\nAround 12:30, when I called to ask if the order was coming (and if not, to cancel it), no one picked up. They were technically closed at midnight, so it\'s about what I expected. But did that mean they were actually going to deliver my order? It was late; it was snowing; I was fine with canceling. I called again a minute later, and someone picked up and hung up on me immediately. At least I knew someone was still there.\n\nI went to bed at 1 am, figuring I\'d ask for a refund the next day. But 10 or 15 minutes later, a driver pulled up outside my house and knocked on the door. I\'d almost rather have not had the thing at that point, and I briefly considered not answering the door. But I did sympathize with the delivery guy. He apologized, said the roads were bad. I could see that they were. I give him some credit for finishing his rounds, but his employer should not have put him through it.\n\nThe next day, after reheating the pizza, I did not care for it. Strictly on the merits of its flavor, I won\'t order from them again. Sorry guys. Food is OK but their delivery service is awful!  One order a few weeks ago took over an hour to be delivered.  It was the first time I ever had a problem so I let it go as a fluke.  \n\nToday I ordered via Grubhub.  Now, if you\'re a Grubhub user you know that everything is timestamped.  Well, it had been close to an hour since my order was marked out for delivery, so I gave them a call.  They said they didn\'t have a record of my order, but it was marked received and out for delivery.  A female employee said "oh we\'ll get it out to you."  The thing is, she never asked what I ordered.  So, you probably did have my order and are full of crap!  They also gave the same bs story to the Grubhub rep (since they ask for feedback after each order).  \n\nI feel sorry for the cooks who put out a good product but your customer service needs serious work!  Not sure what\'s going on because I was a customer off and on for about a year without a problem. Ordered at 11:30 a.m.  I was told it was on it\'s way at noon.  Called at 1p.m.  The person that answered said it would be another 45min because the roads were bad.  I am completely understanding of that. Called again at 2:30p.m., spoke with the same woman and said it was still on it\'s way.  Called again at 5 asking if I should just cancel the order or if it was ever going to show up.  The woman on the phone told me my order was cancelled.  I explained I had not done that. She looked up my order and tried to argue the extra toppings I paid for on the pizza because they weren\'t showing up on the slip (not what you want to do when you\'ve been waiting at your house all day and hungry), they were out of what I requested to drink, if I wanted to receive a refund, I would have to call grubhub...all of this plus 5 hours of waiting for paid food and not one apology or an offer for money back and order.  I\'m sorry but, that\'s the least you can do when someone has waited at home all day for a delivery.  Thank you for using my time, energy, and I still had to call grubhub on my own to get a refund because a half hour passed my last phone call when I was told it would be "5 minutes".  Then the delivery driver showed up about 20 minutes after that and I let her know the order was cancelled and she asked me if I could call the pizza shop and them know?  I just wanted to not deal with any of you anymore. I had to explain to her grubhub called the restaurant and called me back so they definitely knew.  Seriously?  Worst eating experience in Philadelphia.  Or non-eating...however you want to look at it. It was... okay. \n\nTo start, there is so much to order from. They have amazing variety and everything is always cooked perfectly.\n\nHowever, their ingredients seem to be canned or frozen. We ordered a white pizza with anchovies. The anchovies tasted wrong; they tasted off. They tasted as if they were left out near a warm surface, so they were partially cooked instead of just being cured. It was a big turn off.\n\nWe\'ve ordered several times from this establishment and everyone is always polite, friendly, and totally accommodating.\n\nIf I had to make any recommendation to the owner, it would be to keep a close eye on the dressing station and the toppings; if something spoils, it could ruin a lot. I order from this place about a week ago.. The hoagie I had was one of the best hoagies I ever ate. But I will never order from here again because I got chewed out by the driver about the tip. Trying to explain to me the 2 $ for delivery didn\'t go to him and blah blah as if I was an idiot or something... It was very rude... And not professional at all...If he would have just shut up I had cash on me and was about to give it to him I just wanted the amount to even out on my card! Smh it\'s too bad because I really enjoy that hoagie but I having that experience the first time I even order from there made me not ever want to order again! If you are in search of poor customer food service,  then Wolf St. Pizza is the place to go! I put in a 30.00 order and they screwed it all up. It goes like this. We asked for a 2 Litre Ginger Ale and got a 2 Litre Pepsi. When I called them to tell them that they confused our drink order she  stated...."that\'s all we have". Instead of calling us and telling us that they were out of ginger ale, they simply decided that Pepsi tastes just like Ginger Ale....go figure!!   No attempt to remove it from my credit card or even to apologize. It was really a " we don\'t give a !@#$ about the fact that you don\'t drink Pepsi!!\n\nNext, we open up the cheese fries. We ordered cheese fries with salt, pepper and ketchup. Okay, well there was cheese on about four fries, no salt, no pepper, no ketchup!! I called them back and after explaining my concerns three times I get put on hold. Upon returning to the phone the person says "Can I take your order!! " Once again I expressed my frustration about my entire order and  she tells me that she would tell the manager to "see what we can do". After several minutes she returns to the phone to inform me that they could send the driver with a small container of cheese!!! I was over it!! What we wanted was cheese fries made as,we ordered them!!,why would I want to pour cheese over cold, unseasoned fries!!,Not even an offer to correct the poorly prepared fries...no apology from the manager. She then says, Well were getting kinda busy!!, At this point I say..."I don\'t give a damn about you being busy, I just paid $30 for food that tastes and looks like shit!" I never even got to mention that the cheese steak was cold and the bread was hard!! \n\nMy suggestion....don\'t order from Wolf St. Pizza...service and food is horrible!! I plan to inform all of my family and friends that Wolf St. Pizza doesn\'t care about customer satisfaction. I live two blocks away it would have been easy for them to make an attempt to make it right. Never again will I patronize their establishment. Horrible customer service. Placed an order around 10:15. Heard nothing from them for a couple hours and called around 12 to ask if it had gone out yet. Was told that the driver had the food and should be there soon. At 1pm called again and I was told they were going to call the driver and then call me back. They never called me back and then at 2pm I called again and was told that the delivery should only be 30 more minutes. At this point I asked for a discount (as assumed the food would arrive cold) and she asked if she could give me a free 2liter soda instead. If my food was in the car at 12 and I called again at 2 and its only 30min away how am I getting a free soda if the food is out! I said no, dont want a free soda and they said do you want a credit? NOOO I dont want a credit to your shitty establishment. Needless to say I will never order from them again. Food never even came.. I\'ve ordered from here before, never had a problem with the food or service, until tonight. \n\nI ordered a hoagie and fries for delivery, and got a little extra for my money-- A BAND-AID!!  Unwrapped, folded, stuck together, couldn\'t tell if it was used or not.  Thanks, Wolf Street, I appreciate the freebie!  Are you trying out a new, morbid Happy Meal Toy idea?  Do it. Run with that.\n\nI never got to try the food, so I can\'t comment on their culinary prowess.  This one-star rating goes out to the nice delivery guy who came and collected the food AND the band-aid (they asked for it back...speaks to their knife skills and tiny first aid budget, perhaps?).  \n\nNext time I get a paper cut, I\'m ordering a hoagie and fries ASAFP!  "Wolf Street Pizza and Grill: The Jefferson Hospital of Food Delivery" Food was over half an hour late and the restaurant charged my card additional money that I ever authorised and am still waiting for Seamless to refund me. Don\'t risk it. Delivery guy is ASS. He honked the car for about 5 seconds, ran out to bang my door and ring my doorbell to ask if I ordered food. Then went and park somewhere and walked my food over and gave me an attitude saying, "What\'s wrong with your phone?" I\'m like, nobody ever asked me for a phone number. \n\nBut the pie is huge. Pretty pricy though. They also got my order wrong, but it\'s whatever. Spent $26 for a 2 liter soda, 10 hot wings, and a large pizza. Don\'t think I\'ll be ordering there again, but it\'s for a mini pre-gaming party so I didn\'t mind much. ;) I wouldn\'t have rated any stars AT ALL, but that\'s not a choice,sadly.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered a pizza and mozzarella sticks.\n\nWe BOTH got horribly sick and will never be ordering from here ever again. VERY Disappointing. Who would ever order a pizza with NO sauce? Not this girl. However that\'s exactly what I got. A Large Pizza with no sauce, only cheese, and the toppings I ordered. I also ordered, and paid for (2) Garlic Dipping Sauces, which I did not get upon delivery. When I shouted for the delivery guy before he left and told him I ordered dipping sauces he proceeded to search every crevice of his vehicle for (2) sauces. He came up with one that I had ordered, and one that I had not. ( who dips pizza in Blue Cheese Sauce?)  \nThis was all AFTER I had kindly given my hard earned money, and a generous tip to the driver. What a bummer, and certainly not a way to keep a customer. How hard is it to make a pizza? Get it together. update: someone contacted me and gave me a free pizza!\n\nSo last time I ordered from here, they forgot my garlic sauce. No big deal, only $0.50 but my favorite part. This time they delivered half of my order to someone else. If that customer didn\'t call me, I wouldn\'t have known until the driver left and I opened my box. When I told the driver, he then left and came back with the second half of my order. Correct label and address, but the wrong thing inside the box. Just my luck. Check your order before the driver leaves. So last time I ordered from here, they forgot my garlic sauce.

Oh and not to mention my half pepperoni half extra cheese pizza was 3 slices pepp and 5 slices xcheese. And where\'s my ranch for the chicken you messed up? My experience was just Terrible! Awful! I ordered at 7:05 p.m. EST. The pizza never arrived. The tracker even read "delivered" but I never received anything. My first phone call was made in hopes to find out any information on my order. The workers and well as the "so called manager" Will were unknowledgable and offered little to no information about my order or when the order should arrive. I waited 30 minutes later to place another phone call to again find out any information regarding my small pizza order. I was given statements just to get me off the phone. All workers lacked customer service and what it truly means to satisfy the customer. It\'s truly ashame that Dominos, as big of a company as you are, have people of that nature working for you. Your employees represent you as a whole and tonight you were represented so poorly. There was no solutions given or recommendations offered to me after I waited almost 1 hour and 40 minutes for a small pizza. All that was said was "it will be there." completely unacceptable given that I live 7 minutes from the actual location I placed my order. Do better Dominos. For the last time, 1 hour and 30 minutes after placing my order, I called and asked for the manager. I was put on hold and informed that the manager was unavailable and that he stepped out. I asked if a refund could be made on my order and I was told that only a manager would be able to refund the order. I was told to call back, but unfortunately that was very inconvienent for me so I asked to leave my name and good number for the manager to reach me when he arrived so we could make the refund transaction. I was placed on a very long hold. As I was taken off hold, I was told by an employee, NOT THE MANAGER, that the refund was process and it would take 24 hours to clear. I guess I was just a little confused as the prior in the conversation I was told that only a manager could process the refund and that he was not in the store at the time. Very unprofessional. Completely and utterly disgusted and disappointed in the 3400 Aramingo Ave Philadelphia PA 19134 location. What a disgrace! I have been a loyal customer for years and years for O can\'t remember how long, but I definitely am reconsidering remaining a customer of Dominos after this encounter. Very frustrated that you would even allow your employees to treat their customers as if they do not care. Do better. \n\nSINCERELY, \n\nTHEY TRIED IT. Lately they been messing up my orders called them said they will send missing item right over called twice never showed up, called made and order asked for 5 items get 4 didn\'t get charge for the missing one but it showed I asked for 3 of the same item manager wanted me to place order again and pay for the delivery again plus taxes and of course I would have to pay a tip instead of waving the fees on the delivery. the sandwiches suppose to be $5.99 if order 3 or more but because I didn\'t state that they didn\'t come off at that price when I never had to before it should automatically come off get a sandwich that was skimpy on the meat looked more like a flat bread really like the food but considering not supporting this one because the way they handle their mistakes This is absolutely WORST establishment and restaurant history!! The only reason I step in this Shithole of a place is because my son loves pizza and this is the only Domino\'s within my driving range, I\'ve complained via email to Corporate and received a phone call saying they\'ll sit with the employees to rectify their actions at this location.  Each employee there Carry\'s on using profanity and racial slurs out in the open in front of customers including my eight year old, I mention my discomfort the last time I was there and got no respect from your employees, last night I said the same thing respectfully only to be threatened physically by the "manager", after a brief exchange of words he told me that he gets off at 2am if I wanted to take this further.  ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME DOMINOES? I have to be harassed to buy a pizza there. I have several witnesses including 3 Army Soldiers Also pissed their order was taking long AND a Dominoes employee dropping off payroll. There is no excuse on this sort of Bullshit One has to endure and as big a chain franchise as you are I cannot believe you continue to turn a blind eye to this location!!! This place is a disgrace!!! I ordered pizza online, and when I arrived at the store, there were serval workers fooling around in the back and not assisting customers in the front. After 5 minutes of no one assisting me, I eventually left and ordered somewhere else. To add the store was very dirty. I have been coming to this dominos for over a year without issue until the last two times. The last time I ordered pizza the crust was like rubber, there was so much sauce that the overzealous amount of toppings couldn\'t even stay put on it, and the whole thing was SO greasy. I order the same pizza every time (an artisan one) and I\'ve never seen it like that.\n\nWhen I got home I went to cut it (because they had not) I realized just how bad it was. Inedible, pure and simple. And I\'ll eat a lot of stuff...trust me when I say it was that bad. Bad enough that I took it back to the store. They were very apologetic, I heard them throwing out the dough and making a proper batch, and they gave me some garlic sticks for the wait. They made a proper pizza. \n\nToday I went back for the same order and had the same problem. The toppings were ok but the dough is rubber and grease abound. The manager must have remembered me from last week because he was throwing me a funny look the whole time I was there. I got to the car and looked at the pizza, sad to see what I found. This is nearly the only pizza I eat but not anymore, at least not from this dominos. No excuse to serve the same slop twice. They can recognize the problem with their dough and are comfortable enough to still serve it to their loyal customers. Their old manager apparently knew what customer service is. Dominoes at Aramingo ave in philly--Piss poor mamagement and wrong orders here at this dominoes.  NOT to mention the guy making the pizza was on his cell phone, did not wear gloves and kept scratching his head and then continuing to make the pizza..Gross  i always tried to order a lightly cooked extra cheese thin pizza,  they always give me either an extremely burned pizza or the wrong pizza completely.  then they insist they made it correctly,  i been told i ordered it with no oregano... they also will lie! the girl behind the counter needs to find new work. i have walked in there several times and she is lit crying about how much she hates working at this aramingo ave dominoes..that is not what i want to see or hear when i walk into a place to order food. tjey just lost tjemselves another customer I sent them two emails now over a week ago about my experience. I\'ve heard nothing back. Very upsetting. We got two pizzas. One pizza they did not even put any sauce on, the second pizza they put chicken on instead of bacon. These were not the pizzas we ordered. We did not want these pizzas. We haven\'t ordered from this Domino\'s in a long time and now I know why. The food is not worth the money we paid and we were very disappointed. We know it isn\'t Domino\'s, because we enjoy the food from the one in Wildwood, NJ. The specialty buffalo chicken was like mush with the ends burnt. The menu says the wings are smothered in bbq sauce and yet there was only sauce on one side of each wing. We also ordered boneless wings with dipping sauce. The sauce was put onto the chicken instead of coming on the side and it was a new sauce I was planning to try and didn\'t end up liking. We ordered salads and were disappointed to find out that they are prepackaged. They weren\'t  that bad considering, but we ordered an extra dressing and were charged but didn\'t receive. I called the store to try to allow them to resolve the issue with the boneless wings and the extra dressing. I was told they would send out new chicken and the extra dressing. They never sent either. They obviously do not care about the quality of the food or their service to the customers. Always late. Aaalways late. Meaning, if they tell me they\'ll be here in 30-40, it actually means 90-110 min. Pizza has never been delivered as I ordered, it\'s like they make what they want and give it to me. Like it\'s a lottery chance of getting what I actually wanted or something . NEVER AGAIN. GAVE THIS PLACE MANY CHANCES The only good pizza is the hand tossed, and that is average. Brooklyn style is soooo NOT! I am from the Brooklyn area and that pizza bears absolutely no resemblance. The pan pizza is horrible. You hope when you order it, maybe the crust will be thick and kinda greasy and delicious (like pizza hut). It is not. Instead it doesn\'t hold up under the sauce and cheese. \nMy favorite thing from here is the parmesan bites. Last time I got them they forgot the marinara and of course were not coming back. I would have thought they could drop one off when in the area. Pleasing me, a regular customer, not important enough. \nNow that they have stopped giving free parmesan bites to their regular customers there is no reason for me to keep putting up with mediocre pizza. I love a real NY type pizza, from a real pizza shop and there are plenty in the area. I live a few blocks away from this store. \n\nThe order taker at this place couldn\'t locate Huntingdon st on a map \n\nThe store is at Huntingdon st and aramingo \n\nHe had to call back to re verify the order \n\nPizza never showed. \n\n\nFire the phone person who manned the phone in July 15 at 430 pm If I had my druthers, I\'d be a wealthy lottery winner who could hire Joe Beddia to make pizzas for me Sunday through Tuesday when Pizzeria Beddia is closed, but unfortunately, this ain\'t the case. Luckily, I\'ve just discovered Domino\'s Stuffed Cheesy Bread after my cousin\'s girlfriend ordered it after a night out this summer. This stuff is better than Cheetos and I can order it using an app on my phone. How cool is that? Get the cheesy bread and a hand tossed pizza. You can\'t go wrong and it\'s super easy to order half toppings. Solid 4 stars!\n-LJL Horrible pizza experience. Woman was rude to me on the phone. There tracker was off so I called to see what was going on and they acted like it was so crazy I was asking questions. Look I\'m not exactly expecting a lot out of my Domino\'s experience but this was just straight bad. Also Domino\'s has been my drunk food of choice since I was 14 and I need to say that the breadsticks have just gotten so so bad. Probably not the best date night unless you\'re seeing a very "enlightened" chick, if you know what I mean. This place it is edgy; Dr. Sonic ain\'t afraid to take some risks. Throw some chili on a hot dog, deep fry it with some chili and blend that into a smoothie. Now, dump that smoothie on some fries, and blend that. Bacon? Blend it in. Once you\'re done blending, pour that nonsense in the trash - you\'re no mix-master like the Sonic Engineers.\n\nService is great, options are endless, and the movie choices are sub-par. Go for the bahn mi, stay for the love. I thought this place was open 24/7? Rolled up at around 10:30pm with workers inside and no one gave me service. This is the 2nd time at this location. Horrible. The food here isn\'t bad, but it isn\'t the best. The real treat is the ice cream which I think is comparable to dairy queen. This place is also open 24/7 so it adds to the value being you can get your fix any time night or day! I think if they worked on the flavor of their foods they would get better reviews. I am really not a fan of fast food, but I have to say that the Chicago hot dog awesome. Really good combination of flavors and the poppy seed bun just perfectly topped it off. Slowest service ever added with horrible customer service . A real negative link in the sonic chain . I love sonic but this location is bad! Really really long wait, only drive up window service and forgot to include a bunch of items in the meal. Place is really run down and lock your doors, we had people come to the car looking for money. When you have to wait 15 minutes for an Ocean Water to end up getting a Blue Coconut Sprite...... This location closed once before, they need to close again.  An absolute failure in customer service or any service whatsoever! Absolutely horrible. \n\nWent there today, and we were asked to hold three times during ordering. My partner ordered a chili dog with no cheese - and that really confused them. The person taking our order put us on hold to ask a manager whether it\'s possible to make a chili dog with no cheese. The manager then took over, and pretended to ring in the order as we placed it. When the food and check came out, it was clear that she had just rung in a regular hot dog. We\'d also asked for sauces, and unsurprisingly didn\'t get them. So... we went inside to ask for ranch dressing and mustard, and were given honey mustard!!!!!! \n\nTotal waste of money and time. The worst place ever for customer service. Why am I waiting for over 10 minutes for 2 shakes and a hotdog on Super Bowl Sunday and no one is here??Get it together Sonic please.... This place sucks. Every time I come they forget something. How do you forget an entire order? The food is mediocre and way over priced. There\'s always dumb azz kids and old wanna be racers trying to race their rice burners on the street next to sonic. They crowd up the lots and are too rude to move for people who want to try to actually eat something from this dump. I will NEVER come back here. And I\'ll make sure everyone know how much this place sucks. No wonder it was Shut down last year. Why even bother reopening? Shame on me for giving it another shot. This was easily the worst experience I have ever had at any Sonic. I exclusively come here for the frozen drinks. The slushed are amazing on a hot day. But I\'ll never know about this location. While we sat at the parking spot waiting for someone to pick up and take our order we continued to ponder our slush options. Upon having what sounded like a person talking underwater asking us what we needed, we attempted to order. We placed an order for a medium slush...cherry and lemon. We are told it\'s a medium cherry lemonade. We do this circular dance for about 30 seconds trying to get her to ACTUALLY listen and take the order properly. After this, I ask if I can get a soda variety as a slush. 30 seconds of silence..."what?"....I repeat the question.....30 more seconds of silence...."anything else?"....I ask if that\'s a yes or a no....30 more seconds of silence...."an orange fanta slush"...no that\'s not it and you still haven\'t answered the question. After all this we just left. I\'ve heard about the deplorable service here and I\'ll be letting others know about it as well. Good thing there is a Rita\'s down the street with competent employees. Get your act together...you\'re embarrassing all of us. if i could give this 0 stars i would. this is by far the worst sonic in the city of philadelphia. slow service, rude employees, what a mess. one employee had to keep running in and out the building to cars because others found things wrong too. i felt bad for her, she seemed nervous and upset. one of her coworkers were rude to us on the drive thru speaker because she cut us off when we weren\'t even done ordering so we had to do two seperate transactions. we were waiting in the drive thru for about 45 minutes to an hour for everything. This jawn is the worst the food sucks and the service sucks they always get you order wrong or give you old cold food. They have little kids running this place. I will never eat from this Sonic or any other sonic again. I\'ve been sitting in this drive thru for 15 mins...it took 10 mins for them to take my order...and now there\'s a huge line of cars behind me...I\'ve never actually had good service here. Pretty awful every time. People please don\'t waist your time eating at Sonic. Service is the worst and the food is too! Make sure u bring a PUKE BAG with you. I HAD to try out this drive in. Ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, chili cheese tots and a strawberry limeade and it was delish! Although the chili cheese tots were a bit too salty for my taste. Service and delivery was quick and staff was extremely friendly. Between two people, we spent about $15, which was really reasonable. \n\nOverall, Sonic is a great place if you want to try something new. Terrible experience from the beginning to end. The attitude of the girl at the drive threw was awful. And the food was even worse. Burnt! Dried out! And just terrible. \nWe didn\'t look at our food till we got back to are hotel room or we would have asked for a refund and went elsewhere. \nLook at my picture to see how bad it was! I give this place 3 stars because of the location. I went for the first time last Friday and the place was super crowded! There were old ass Hondas everywhere parking lot pimping. An hour later the cops came and cleared the lot. Besides that the food is ok...I only came for the slushies. My advice - go during the day. Eh. Not much to talk about. One complain their food sizes are very small. At least for adults. They often mess up the sizes of drinks. But usually they make it bigger and charge you for smaller so it is okay. It can be fun to eat on the go though so that keeps this place at 3 stars. Got to admit they have some tasty food. Their large fry is a Burger King small. At least close to it. But due to tasty food and the fun setting in the car I give it 3. However you due need a lot of room to store your order. In the front you can use the dashboard. In the back just use extra seats. I can say this, eating in the car is better than outside on the tables. One time we tried that and our pile of napkins flew everywhere and we needed to fetch them. Also the birds love to steal food. Or at least try to. I suggest putting a napkin over any food containers to try and keep heat inside. So yeah the car is better. Avoid at all costs! If I could give this Sonic location on Butler Street zero stars, I would. We didn\'t even get our order due to the blatant incompetency of the girl who was supposed to be taking our order. Rude, apathetic, incompetent and barely able to communicate are some adjectives that accurately describe her demeanor. Deplorable lack of customer service. I\'ve been to many Sonic locations around the country and never had to pull away workout completing an order before. The owner of this location should be ashamed to put someone so incapable of basic human interaction on the intercom, and the entire place needs training in customer service basics. I understand this is a fast food drive in, not the Ritz, but you need a minimum of intelligence to work with the public. Complete fail, Sonic. It is the closest sonic. Their happy hour is amazing! The  shakes, ice cream and slushies are on point. The food sucks. Super salty. Avoid this place on weekend evenings/ nights! So many ricer cars, super loud ratchet exhausts and you will get a ton of mean mugging racers that hang out there. I have never used the curbside service. The drive thru moves even on busy nights. I\'m always in the mood for Chinese, so I came here at 8AM before a flight.\n\nThe person at the counter was quick, and I had my combo of bourbon chicken, chicken and broccoli and lo mein within 60 seconds of walking up, which is exactly how any airport food place should be.\n\nThe food didn\'t taste special, and the broccoli had too much stalk on them.  I probably wouldn\'t come back here, but it wasn\'t bad. GAVE ME FOOD POISONING! Do not eat here! I ate the chicken and rice combo and it destroyed me. I was flying to Europe and after about 2-3 hours in the air it hit me. Throwing up in a tiny airplane bathroom for 6 hours with turbulence in the middle of the night was one of the worst experiences in my life. Landed in Europe and was still throwing up. This place is disgusting, can\'t belie the Philadelphia airport would allow this junk to be in their terminals. Awful food. Just threw it away. The chicken was so cheewy that couldn\'t even get it chewed If I could give this place a negative star rating due to the humiliating experience I had I would. After we asked for different options (and subsequently a refund) because the noodles were over cooked, chicken raw and then egg roll empty, we were made to sit there and were yelled at by the manager, embarrassed in front of others in line. Nearly refusing to give back our card after asking for a refund because they asked for the receipt which they never gave us (not something I always worry about with food- pretty obvious where I got it). I literally had to pull the card out of the manager\'s hand. I\'ve never been more embarrassed and humiliated. Do not go there- you\'ve been warned. No Asian customers were standing in line...not a good sign.\n\nOn the bland side.\n\nRaise prices $1-2 and offer something better.\n\nWill fill you up for $9 in an airport\n\nGood seating in area with free Wi-Fi\n\nSmall Gripe: "Cash Only" sign day I visited. Suspect they were saving on the merchant fee?? pretty standard fast chinese food at an airport.  \n\nMy experience wasn\'t as bad as others, but it wasn\'t exactly great.  Panda Express would be better suited here I don\'t know why this restaurant is listed as being in concourse F. It\'s actually in the BC connector, right next to Philadelphia Marketplace. My main criticism of this place is that there is no menu with prices posted. I had to ask how much everything was.\n\nI am aware of the other bad reviews, but I can only review based on what I had. I wasn\'t in the mood for a full entree, but I did order an egg roll and egg drop soup. Although the egg roll was slightly dry, it still had great flavor. The egg drop soup also had good flavor with the right texture. I found it interesting this place puts peas and carrots in their egg drop soup. \n\nWould I come here for the other items available? I am not sure. Would I come here for the egg drop soup and egg roll again for less than $4? Yes. So I ordered the spicy chicken (1 entree) and a side of veggies...they charged me for 2 entrees and a side. They tried explaining it, but none of it made sense and I was hungry. I let it go, hoping the food would be decent. NO. No no no. This is probably the worst Chinese food in an airport that I have ever had. My spicy chicken was 3 strips of chicken and mostly just mushy veggies. Save your money and go elsewhere! I didn\'t want to pay $18 for a bowl of noodles at the asian bistro just down the hall, so I opted for this place when I saw you could get a combo plate for $7.50.  I\'m not one to thumb my nose at food court chinese (it\'s actually a guilty pleasure of mine), but this place was just bad.  The bourbon chicken needed more sauce/flavor, and from one scoop of it, I had to spit out about four chunks of gristle.  The orange chicken at least had flavor, if not that of oranges, but it was about 1/3 meat, 1/3 fat, 1/3 chewy breading.  The noodles were kinda dry and flavorless.  Even the cherry coke tasted like it needed more syrup.  The \'service\' was good, but not good enough to make up for the utter failure to produce good food. Panda Express rip off. Tried to charge me a dollar extra for fried rice after barely giving me any.\n\nBourbon chicken and fried rice got the job done. Worst food ever. I ate it unfortunately as was in rush but already sick. These guys need to be checked if they are even following safety on meats etc. The food here may have been passable, I don\'t know. But the staff was so rude that I simply turned around and walked away. What set them off? Who knows...\n\nNow that I see the rest of the reviews, I guess it\'s par for the course. Sorry guys, too much competition in this airport than to waste my time and money with you. Instead I went over to Legal Seafood and spent quadruple what I would have spent here. Disappointing, walked all the way from F to A gates to get Chinese and it was skimpy portions with almost no meat. At least I got some exercise. Pretty good Asian food, or at least the bourbon chicken is good.  The orange chicken is also good, though the noodles and rice are both a bit plain and way to oily. Pretty horrible for Chinese food, but at least you can get real, unprocessed broccoli and string beans for prices that aren\'t too crazy.  As far as healthy-ish options go here, it looks like either this or Au Bon Pain.  The wine bar across the way looks tempting, but chinese food and wine tasting don\'t really go well together . . . and I doubt it\'s going to hold anything interesting for a wino from California.  And probably cost a ton.\n\nOh yeah, Asian Chao.  The servers bark at you, too, keep their head down, and don\'t seem to care who they\'re talking to.  Lady next to me asks for napkins, so they give them to me.  And they also seem to have no idea whose order is whose. It is what it is. \n\nQuick airport faux Chinese. If you\'re on a diet you can get the Bourbon Chicken with out rice or noodles for$6 \n\nIs Bourbon Chicken Chinese. Don\'t think so since the only place you can get it is at a Food Court in a mall or airport. \n\nAnyway it\'s not bad for cheap fast airport food.\n\nAnd when you read the other reviews. They are pretty much spot on. I think they are expecting too much from what this place is. \n\nBut when I\'m in a food court I don\'t usually buy my drink from the place I buy food. I may just buy my chili from one place. My fries from another and a drink from another. \n\nDon\'t expect much here and you won\'t be disappointed. Decent and unremarkable Chinese food option in the food court, but neither the prices nor the quality are anywhere near Panda Express.  Have to ask for chopsticks if you want them.  As other reviewers have commented, prices are slightly high for what you\'re getting. I had the most upsetting experience with these people. I called to ask if they delivered to my address. The girl said my address was in their system. She asked for my phone number. Then there was whispering between her and a male employee. She said the number I gave did not match the number in their system. I said maybe it was an old phone number. She didn\'t ask me to give them an old number. I asked if there was a problem and she proceeded to take my order and give me a total of $15.21 and said they would deliver. I waited over an hour for my pizza, then called back to ask what was going on. They claimed that I got off the phone before she confirmed the order and that they did not in fact deliver to my address, which was an outright lie. I had confirmed with them several times that they would deliver, since they acted so strange during the call. I asked why no one had called me to say they would not be delivering my pizza and they claimed they had called me three times. I did not get a call!!! Why did they do this and why did they then lie about it??? Don\'t get food from these people, they don\'t deserve your business!!! Don\'t know what happens to this store? They use to be good. Fast delivery, good services, and good pizzas. I stop ordering pizza from Pizza Hut and started getting my pizza at Papa Johns.  Because of this store I\'m going back to Pizza Hut. Twice I order for delivery and both time it took more than 1 hour 45 minutes for my pizza to come. When the pizzas finally came, they were cold. That I don\'t mind but what bothered me the most was the pizza dough were raw. I\'m not letting my daughter eat raw dough. The pizza wasn\'t cooked all the way.  I had to recook them in my oven again.  Now my daughter has to wait an additional 15 minutes for the pizza she used to love.  2 weeks ago I got out off work and my daughter called me to pickup pizza for her.  I google papa johns phone number and call the store to place an order. Before I place the order I want to know if I am ordering at the right location. Some guy answer the phone with a nasty attitude. I asked for the address and is the cross intersection is Harbison? I was just making sure I wasn\'t ordering at a wrong location. But this guy didn\'t give me an answer. He kept on saying "were" are on Roosevelt blvd, "were" are on Roosevelt blvd. I just say thanks and bye. Didn\'t want to place a order with this guy he might do something nasty and dirty to my pizza. I just drove there and order in person. Had to wait 45 minutes for one medium chicken spinach alfredo. I don\'t really know what happens to them? We ordered delivery because the app said they were the closest. Waited and waited then called back to see where it was and  they said they were going to call but they don\'t deliver to us we were too far.  So it may be the apps fault but they should look at the address when it comes in. It was exactly 1 hour 2 min from the time I ordered and the time I called to see where it was. If they were actually going to call me who knows. This placed deserves a zero. My husband and I ordered several times and every time we experienced unprofessional, juvenile service. Our order(s) was messed up every single time, and the staff, including the manager appeared to find it amusing. The unprofessionalism is so thick you can cut it with a knife. There is definitely a need for customer service, diversity, and time management training. There employee choices seem to be recently incarcerated inmates. I\'m all for rehabilitation, however, the manager of this store is extremely ignorant and doesn\'t seem to give a shit. Don\'t let his smile fool you. This place blows. Take your money elsewhere. I thought I was back in Florida It took.1hr. 50 min. To get a pizza delivered. Terrible. I\'ve had SO much trouble with this location. Every time I try to order using a code they advertise (day after a Phillies win), the store gives me the run around. I try using the app, but that also seems intentionally problematic, as it only offers specialty pizzas when you enter the code. Extremely frustrating. This review is a visit for myself and fiance\'s anniversary dinner in January. We were broke and still wanted to celebrate so don\'t hate. Aha.  Forget our total because I had a $25 giftcard from Christmas, but, service and product was good as usual even seated at the bar. This chain never disappoints. This is a block from my job so it\'s very convenient. I usually get the 2 for $20 with co-workers. I have tried to call ahead to save time to arrive and someone has lost our order. So you have to order then sit there. I\'ve eaten there a few times at lunch. It is always empty so we\'re quickly seated. One time the service was horrible and another superb. It\'s so inconsistent, hit or miss. The one time that my order was not forgotten over the phone I went directly to the to go side to pay for my order. Someone that looked like a manager (not wearing the usually apron or shirt servers wear but black pants and shirt) was on the phone on a personal call. Didn\'t stop his call and totally ignored me. One of the servers took pity on me and checked me out but whispered to not disturb the call. WTH! My biggest complain is that the food wasn\'t fresh or at least didn\'t taste like fresh. I had the steak with portobello mushroom and the potatoes tasted like they were kept in the fridge for weeks. My wife\'s pepper steak also was not very good. Side dishes (spinach and mashed potato) seemed preprepared/reheaten. Even the sirloin itself wasn\'t tasty. I\'m giving two stars because at least I was well attended. It is a shame because the location is great and the menu seems well chosen. OK, as many of you know I loathe chain restaurants, but I tried (I really did) to keep an open mind when a colleague of mine - who likes it here - wanted to have lunch here.  (She also graciously paid for lunch - and she is a good friend.)\n\nAfter our server took our orders she quickly brought drinks and water.  The Philly-tap water tasted just awful.  So I drank my diet coke and kept quiet.  (I am a big water drinker and had a bottle of brita-ized water with me.)\n\nWe passed on the 2 for 20 deal and both got salads. I had the Shrimp/Avocado salad and the salad, was really not good.  Strangely enough the lettuce was just fine, but the shrimp were so oversalted/seasoned.  Also the avocado had obviously been chunked much earlier in the day as it was brown and slightly dried out.  Eew.\n\nAnd thank god I got the gloppy green avo-based dressing on the side.  It was awful.\n\nThus, my faith in Applebee\'s has yet to be restored.\nNext time I\'ll go to Shiroi Hana across the street.  What possesed me?  Oh yeah - a colleague wanted to come here. Pretzel appetizer was disappointing  :(   too many seasonings going on at one time\n\nThe berry sangria is tasty but loaded with ice so I am not sure how much beverage I actually had!\n\nThe waitress was excellent! It\'s alright if you\'re not expecting much.  I do love the half off appetizers, though. You can\'t go wrong with nachos for about 4 bucks.\nThe service is hit or miss.  Sometimes you get really good service and sometimes it falls flat.  \nAll in all, it\'s okay.  Not the best but also not the worst.  If you keep an open mind about it, it\'s not too bad.  Be aware though; a lot of college kids tend to go here so be ready to see someone you know. Being somewhat skeptical of chain restaurants in general, particularly in a city where there are thousands of independently owned and managed restaurants and cafes, you\'d be hard pressed to find me at a chain restaurant EVER, unless it\'s really something special.\n\nApplebees...is not. Don\'t bother. Seriously. Check out Good Dog, Misconduct Tavern, or Monk\'s instead. Stopped by ,five of us ,on a Sunday night .crowded ,waited for a table ..that\'s understandable..food is okay ,with a few shining stars on the menu ..chicken won ton tacos appetizers are really good .  The burgers were okay ,kids loved them.some stuff is annoying ,asked for well done burger for myself ,it was still pink.ick.big ick for me ...\nalso waitress forgot our appetizers ..we were eating them with our meals ..\nalso the check was brought out Yo settle before we received our orders of desserts ..we get it ,we are hurrying !\nnice waitress even with the blips..\nexpensive fair food though ... Let\'s start with food.  Definitely disappointed, but not surprised... Applebee\'s food just isn\'t Chili\'s grade.  Ordered the half-rack ribs, mashed potatoes and cole slow.  Ribs were from a miniature pig (size of my palm), not to mention a little tough around the edges.  Lots of bone, not much meat.  Cole slaw tasted like something out of the box.  No sweet flavor to it, very garden-ish.  Definitely not southern.  This is not the south, so I guess I can\'t hold that against them.\n\nCustomer service is pretty good.  Staff is friendly, but not very natural.  Even the server "small talk" seemed scripted and fake.  Natural or not, the server was still very nice, very timely and frequently asked if I needed anything.  Could get a sense that the server crew enjoyed their jobs and worked well together.\n\nAfter only taking seconds to eat the small half-rack of ribs, I asked the server if I could get the other half, with no additional sides, and pay for the full rack, .  For some reason, that was not an option, saying "I\'ll have to charge you for another half-rack." (pointing to the point-of-sale computer.  Now last time I checked, two halves equal a full.  Unless they are ripping off people with the size of a full rack.  Apparently two halves don\'t make a whole at Applebee\'s -- fuzzy math.\n\nFor casual dining, I still think other brands far exceed what Applebee\'s offers.  Although this location was in walking distance to my hotel, I\'ll not return. Bathroom looked like a combination of a war zone and a college bar, really disgusting. Service was OK, manager was nice, food was what you would expect - OK. I wish they will go away and let another restaurant more deserving of the historical bookbinders building occupy the location. Now I don\'t expect a lot from a chain like Applebee\'s, however I do expect courteous hosts and professional wait staff. All I can say is stay away!!! Waited 10 minutes to put my name in....but wait had to remind the hostess to take it.....staff looked unkempt and spoke unprofessionally. Walked right out! Applebee\'s corporate office should take a long hard look at this location and revamp! well what can i say about applebees? its applebees...this one just gives a damn about its customers. i ordered my food and the waiter put in the wrong order. i dont mind this since it was 8pm on friday night. so i took the food- yummy either way!!!!--- apperently he overheard me drooling over the maple butter blondie so he brought me one!!1 free of charge for the eariler mix up. that kind of sentiment will always keep me loyal to APPLEBEES!!!! it\'s a chain..that being said it still should be worth a trip and a bill of almost fifty smackers for three...soup is always good , burgers are fine...had the chicken taco wonton appetizer twice..and good but different each visit...odd..\nlast visits server was a nice guy...they all seem a bit too "happy "though.\ncelebrating a birthday here gets you an ice cream thingy with chocolate ,and an in your face clapping song. Stopped by while in town and it happened that Thursday was Karaoke night. Really cool, young crowd. I\'d go again for the drinks and the karaoke. I\'m sorry, I can\'t help but love these chain restaurants. I\'m not sure if their menu qualifies as such, but I find their food comforting, so I call them "comfort food." I like the salads, their seafood dishes, and their burgers. You REALLY have to kill the quality for me to hate it because I don\'t set the tier high when I visit chain restaurants. Just satisfy my cravings and give it to me in a reasonable time and I\'m totally cool.\n\nThis place hasn\'t disappointed me so far, but it also isn\'t OMG excellent so I think 4 stars would suffice. How do I start? Overcooked steak, ok drinks, food smells like a fart... waitress Chay was excellent, so I can\'t blame anything on her. Warning- if you go here and no one is here, there\'s a reason! This is a last resort place. Go to Good Dog or Max Brenner across the street. EW. Food was cold and gross. Servers were unfriendly, discussing issues between employees right in front of the customers, and very unprofessional. The food seems to be pre-packaged and warmed up like a frozen dinner.  If I wanted a frozen dinner, I\'d buy one.  The reason I feel like this is pretty accurate is because when I have asked for parts to be left out I am always told that that is not possible because it is all made "together" and that just seems a little fishy to me.  I know that other chain restaurants do make their ingredients as fresh as possible and so I try to go places where I CAN get things removed from my salad or meal.  I am just not digging a place where they tell ME how I want my meal and what I can and cannot have.  FAIL. Although it\'s very busy on a Saturday afternoon, this is not one of the better Applebee\'s.   My wife\'s steak was overcooked twice.  The last time she ate it because she was starving. The desserts were too sweet and the service was marginal.  There are better choices downtown. Our server was great, but we were seated right by the kitchen where there is a terrible smell. I had the homey bbq boneless wings which were great, but my main entree had no taste. I also ordered the new blackberry sangria and it tasted horrible - don\'t waste your money on it. The chocolate dessert with ice cream we had was good, too. I don\'t think I\'ll be back here. Applebee\'s, Applebee\'s...\n\nI thought this place was OK before but I honestly don\'t know what I was thinking. I didn\'t get rude customer service but I didn\'t really like my food at all.\n\nI ordered the cajun shrimp pasta and I recommend you NOT to get this.\n\nThe BF got the French dip sliders and they\'re okay.\n\nThe soups were way too salty-- we tried the tomato basil and the french onion. https://www.google.com/amp/www2.philly.com/philly/health/special_reports/clean-plates/philadelphia-restaurant-inspections-health-clean-plates-20180918.html%3FoutputType%3Damp\n\n\nI really don\'t expect this from Applebee\'s. Significant health violations. I came here with a friend, he ordered an entree I just asked for an appetizer. My appetizer ended up being sent to another table, the waitress came and told me she would see what she could do. By the time my friend are his entire meal, I finally got the appetizer. The waitress did not seem to care much, she did not even apologize for the wait. I was not trying to make a big deal of it, nor was I trying to be stingy but when she brought the bill I was charged full price for an appetizer I ordered and had to eat after my friend had already finished their food. Having worked in a similar position, if this were to happen to one of my guest I would do my best to offer an additional menu item of speak with a manager to see if the person could get either a refund or a coupon for a future visit. When I couldn\'t hold it in anymore and began to complain to the waitress about the poor service she simply explained to me why it wasn\'t her fault. I will never set foot in this place because I just cannot deal with the lack of professionalism. I should\'ve asked for manager but was so upset I just wanted to leave. Its too dark for starters. The waitress I had was rude and she didn\'t attend to my table often. When it came to the check I already decided it was no tip for her but to my surprise there was the $7 tip.\n\nShe also told me I could fit a whole bowl of pasta into a small container. This bowl was huge! The food was okay but it was service. Food was good, waitress was friendly but not very good. Both our drinks were empty and she didn\'t ask if we wanted a refill. She asked if we wanted dessert when I was only half way done with my lunch, then she asked if we wanted the check, I said "yes" and continued eating. When we got the change, we were shorted by 60¢. I ended up having to give her a 20% tip because I didn\'t have any singles and the change she gave me were three $5\'s and one $1 so I\'m dropping my rating from 3 to 2 stars.  There\'s so many better places to eat lunch at in Center City. I know, I know - chain restaurants!! I usually only visit them when in my hometown (because that\'s all there is), but some friends got it in their heads that it would be fun to order fruity drinks and save a few bucks doing the "Two for Twenty" deal.\n\nDid we have buyers remorse? Yes. Indigestion? Most likely. A good time? Definitely.\n\nUpon hearing where we\'d be dining, my husband said, "There\'s an Applebees in Center City?" \n\nWe went into the evening with low expectations for food and service, but to our pleasant surprise, the service was actually great. The food, however, was not. \n\nIf you live in Philly, then you expect superior quality when it comes to food. You know Applebees will not deliver. However, for those who hail from cities where chain restaurants are the norm, then this place is a safe choice when it comes to dining. Perhaps that\'s why it exists. I would give minus rating to the hole! Worst place I\'ve eaten in 20 years. We had a few kids and thought it would be ok. Everything anyone ordered was put down at one time. Soup with no broth, terrible service, ends with stem on sandwiches, never given knives and when we asked we were give what a butcher might use! This place is just awful!! AWFUL!! One of the best ones in Philly,kind of fast and their food is always hot...also very good service! They get 4 stars because it is just applebees but their wait staff has earned it I usually get waitress\'s with pissy little attitudes then we have to ask for another waiter or snubb em on the tip and I hate to do that but y I should I give a tip when your giving me tude for no reason but this applbees great staff. Came here for happy hour on cinco de mayo with friends. Workers honestly seemed annoyed at us and rude. We asked them multiple times if they were mad at us. Don\'t know if I would return. I am in love with Applebee\'s! This one has great service. The hostess was inviting and the server took care of my friend and I. Half off appetizers after 9 and Long Island specials on Fridays. I\'d highly recommend this place to anyone considering a place to eat at in the area. My fiance decided to take us out to dinner ( around  9-ish) 3 weeks ago and I\'m already looking forward to going again. \n\nIt was my first visit and I didn\'t know what to expect from the chain,but, it was well worth it. We got burgers (bacon and quesadilla) with onion rings to share, all fantabulous. Their appetizers are huge and we actually had like half a container to take home with us.\n\nThe drinks are actually strong and well priced. We enjoyed the shit out of our "Perfect Margaritas". \n\nService was friendly and quick. My last review of the night goes to the absoultely worst place in centre city Philadelphia. If you know me, you know i absoultely HATE to give out one star rates but this place was gosh awfull ! It was my birthday weekend and my south Philly girls wanted to take me out for a few drinks and some tasteflul food. where do i even start with this restaurent... Terrible ! Gross!  Sticky! They have the secret recipe for disaster. First of all the crew and i walk in and are immediately greeted by the hostess and sat down quickly. all is well! it immedeiatly goes downhil from there. We waited for nearly 30 minutes until our waitress came to ask for our drinks! Yes it took that long I am not exagertating!! We were wainting for so long we told her we want to order with the drinks. Love my gals we all shared some appertizers and had some sangritas! anyway let me tell you about the place. Filth... the place was filled with food all over the floor and the place was noteven that buzy!! come on now applebee. Out sharing plates were still dripping wet with dirty dishwater, yucko clean up! i took a pic i will ad. When our food did come the waitres SPILLED all my chips on the table and on the floor. She did get moe chips for me but where is training?  That was the last time we saw her. never filed our water . I also got the chicken three cheese cavatoppy. Decent at best. I feel bad because she must have been knew and probly had little to no training. Thank the heaven that the drinks were good and strong. Only thing that didnt ruin our little girl night out! Will not be returning to this applebees! you shoudlnt either..\nTalk to you soon Yelp, lots of love!!- Fran xo So I was looking for a place close to my work to grab a quick bite to eat. I was in the mood for pasta (I know there are a few good places around there) that would not cost an arm an a leg (and yes, that is the kicker). I settled on Applebee\'s pick two lunch special. \n\nI ended up ordering the 3 cheese chicken penne pasta and the broccoli Cheddar soup. The broccoli and Cheddar soup was actually quite good. Unfortunately, it was the tiniest of portions. \n\nHowever, the pasta was just awful. There was hardly any alfredo sauce on it at all. The chicken was almost inedible. It had flecks of black "char" on it. However, the char was terribly, terribly bitter. I am not really confident that it was char at all. I would not be surprised if it was really just a bit of ash scooped up and sprinkled on the chicken. :p There was not really grill mark patterns to the char. \n\nAdding insult to injury, prices "start at $5.99", but nothing on the website indicates what, if anything, bumps up the price. I ended up paying over $8, including taxes for this tiny, unsatisfying meal. Actually the worst service in all of philadelphia I could\'ve scavenged food from dumpsters like a raccoon for faster and better quality This place is seriously less than one star. I have been here plenty of times due to location but always leave unsatisfied. I have recieved undercooked cold chicken , overpriced small appetizers, nonappetizing burgers ect. Anyone that gives two or more stars is niave or ignorant. There is never a wait here take that as a clue, they hardly clean bathrooms or bar its disgusting!!!! Bourbon Street Steak was pretty good. However it was way to loud in there I couldn\'t wait to leave. Good service. The green bean crispers and triple hog sandwich are both awesome and really good deals for the price! I\'ve unfortunately had the pleasure of eating here on two separate occasions and both experiences were bad. When you first enter the restaurant you are greeted by the most unfriendly hostesses. Also, the food is slow to come out and is luke warm at best. On our last visit not only did a member of our party not receive their meal, but another received someone else\'s meal which happened to contain some pieces of cardboard. Unfortunately, our server was too busy chatting with his comrades to notice or care. Needless to say we asked another server for our check and left. Avoid this Applebees at all costs!!! The best food. And to me very inexpensive! Try the steak/parmigiana shrimp combo. It\'s the best! Drinks are to die for! I eat here at least once a week. Nice setting rather it\'s single, couple, family, work or play. They all work here. Kitchen staff are on point. The Waite staff gets the food out in a reasonable time, while you sip on a delicious cocktail. I strongly recommend this spot. You can tell the any poppin\' place by the crowd. Even during the week, it\'s a nice crowd. During the end of the week/weekend, a short wait. The operative word is,"short". Our waitress, kept forgetting our food. She was not attentive at all, we sat for 15min for mayo for our burgers, by the time she came back the fries was so cold. She brought out the wrong order twice. Another server brought a hot plate of food out for my one year old to eat!! Who gives toddlers hot food?!! I will never go to another applebees location in my life. You truly have to appreciate the great food Apple  bees  provides.  A flavorful 4oz steak,spinach and artichoke dip,asparagus,mash potatoes,and meatball appetizers. It was a great meal for me and my fiance. Thanks apples bees ! Stopped in for a late night dinner with couple other friends. Haven\'t been here for a very long time because the food here is not good compare to other restaurants in the area. Food is still bad. The manager on duty is rude. If you don\'t want to sound too much money on food in the area, skip Applebee\'s, try Ruby Tuesday at 17th and chestnut. Time for a more recent trip and it\'s still gravy.\n\nWent here for late lunch/early dinner during a Friday afternoon with an old friend of mine a couple weeks ago. \n\nI got the Take 2 with the steak & the wedge salad while she ordered the cajun shrimp pasta. I also got a Coronarita. \n\nBoth of our entrees were great and my drink was huge.  Literally a goblet. The potatoes that came with the steak were excellent. Really would love to know what the sauce/seasoning was. All-in-all, our bill came came to about $34+tip. Service was fine as always. First ones in and the only ones around and the sever never came around after our food was dropped. The quality of the food was nothing close to what was pictured. I even had to yell across the restaurant for another drink and her response while on her phone was "I forgot I y\'all were here. Oops!" I haven\'t been to a Applebee\'s in 3 years and was excited to try your food based on the pictures seen, I will not be returning to your establishment. #Applebee\'s- the crumbiest restaurant in existence.  Patrick, our server, tried hard, but it couldn\'t make up for it.  I was embarrassed having suggested it to my colleagues for lunch. \n\nAs far as the food that I had, the lunch combo was a half roast beef sandwich with onions and cheese. It came with a mixed greens salad.  The salad did not taste fresh, was clearly from an industrial bag of greens that they opened a month ago. The half sandwich was so amazing greasy *and* almost only salt.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and head elsewhere. Was staying at the Le Meridien and the guys at the front desk recommended some pub across the street from Applebees.  Well the pub was super busy, I had just flown from SNA-PHL and we decided to walk in the cold to the pub.  \n\nFast forward a few minutes and we\'re over at the Applebees.  20 minute wait unless we wanted to eat in the bar area.  Bar area we went.  Over a water and crispy tacos for me and a soda and bbq chicken sandwich for him, we caught up about everything.\n\nService was pretty good for the bar area.  \nReally loud TVs and patrons. Blah.  Not that I was expecting anything different, but seriously, I couldn\'t hear my fellow diner talk to me.\n\nI don\'t have a reason to go back, but it is a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat. I\'ll be upfront, I\'m not a big fan of chain restaurants, especially in a city known for its eateries. However, I was given a few gift cards to the place and decided to use them a few times. That said, what can I add about an assembly line? Quality was consistent, as I expected, wait time was typical for an eatery and considering the location, the staff were quite good. \n   On two visits the place was not busy but it still took the server several passes to notice my beverage was empty. I haven\'t had any of the alcohol beverages here so I can not comment on them. Overall, expect typical chain restaurant food but for the price there are so many better choices in the area. I like the TV audio remotes at the bar. If you don\'t like what you are watching you can change stations, increase or lower the volume yourself.  And listen to something else than the group next to you.  \n\nThey have good specials, particularly after 9pm when they have a cheap apps menu for the bar. However I stopped getting my lunch takeout here because of the automatic gratuity added. If I want to be generous I\'ll give a tip. The food is sort of plain and I believe the automatic grat has the potential to only detract from the urgency of the service. Seating was fast and the staff was honestly super friendly from the start. We came on Saturday night and it didn\'t look busy at all. Once we were seated our server informed us that there was no clean silverware for whatever reason so we had to eat with plastic forks and knives of what I\'m guessing was part of the "to-go" utensils. Once we ordered and received our food we noticed that the plate that had preserved sweet potato fries instead of regular fries had about 14 fries while my friends that ordered regular fries got a decent portion of fries.  The serving size of that grilled lemon chicken was terrible and not worth the money. Given that this is chain restaurant I expect more of it. Joseph our waiter was super friendly, outgoing and just overall good vibes and was quick to fix the fries issue, I know the things that we really dislike was not his fault. The staff and our server are the only reasons I didn\'t give this Applebee\'s 1 star. This is the worst Applebees I\'ve ever been too. Shitty, slow service and food is not up to par. I prefer Applebees on City Avenue any day over this place! I don\'t like that nobody was there when we showed up. If we had paid online, we would have to wait for the longest time! Also the waiters were just standing around looking at us and not offering us seats at the restaurant!!! The place was sooooooooooooo dirty and not fit for food consumption. We left and went to the Cheesecake Factory! When the wraps are that good, I start to not care about the service! \nThis place is so ghetto, service sucks, waitresses are rude but when you finally get your meal, it\'s fantastic.  The wraps especially are so good. Best burgers I have had in a while. The fries were fresh and hot and the price was inexpensive for what you get. Absolutely delicious!!! Next time I am in Philly I will be stopping by here again. :) Once the traditional Jewish deli, with awesome food , it is now Korean owned and took a steep dive as far as quality and service. It became a beer take out haven too, not what this proud neighborhood deserves, I see the other reviews were done 3 years ago, it\'s changed for the worse . Go across the street to Mayfair diner The food is alright, but that\'s it.\n\nThe service was rude, the food was expensive, and I swear I saw the cook picking their nose. I could be wrong on that one though. I also noticed an employee taking uneaten pickles from dirty tables (or rather the tables that the customers have just left from; even the "clean" tables are dirty) and re-using them.\n\nWould not recommend unless someone else is treating and they insist. Literally the worst fast food I ever had. I took one bite out of the cheesesteak and had to throw it out. But the customer service was even worst. I asked how long the delivery would about a hour after I ordered and the guy on the phone had a major attitude. I hate to write a review like this but this place really sucks. But I will say the delivery driver was nice. Ordered a special, they forgot my cheesesteak, and took a little long to deliver it to our Inn, but the lady was nice enough to provide us with an extra cheesesteak and fries for free due to the inconvenience. The food was great also! My first order here was terrible. Pizza was undercooked and cheese had slid off most of the pizza. Fries, just ok. Delivery took awhile.\nSince they\'re new to the area I decided to give them a second chance and was that a mistake. Ordered our pizza well done hoping that would fix the issue the first time I ordered here. It sorta of did, it was better but still flimsy. Worst part were the wings. Way undercooked to the point we couldn\'t eat them. Oh, well at least we can eat the celery right? Sure, all one piece of it. Really? Considering the state of the wings I guess they thought we didn\'t need much celery and they were right I suppose. Avoid this place. I really, truly wanted to like it here. We LOVED it when it was Fat Daddy\'s.. but since the new guys took over, it\'s just been inconsistent and unorganized. The new counter is way too high, the ordering process takes too long & as a breakfast lover, I\'m disappointed the breakfast they offer is pre-made and isn\'t even real egg. The staff is pretty nice, but most reek of cigarettes and are not very attentive. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad one day, and there were bones in my salad. I tried giving the place a chance..it\'s walking distance to my home and I have limited access to transportation, so it\'s really convenient, but considering the only "good" things there are the fried stuff, it\'s not worth it to me anymore. It breaks my heart that I\'d rather not patronize there, as it is a small business..I\'m a small business owner and believe in supporting small business.. but I think they opened too soon. Train your staff better (especially on your ordering system), have better quality food and be consistent. Ok, I will be the first to review this location. This is where I use to go when I need Internet. It was cozy here. New comfortable seats replaced old ones. Overall most McDonalds are renovating their restaurants to make their settings more futuristic and edgy. There is usually different crowds that like to sit around and chill at McDonald\'s like cafe shops. Im guilty of this too in the past. It\'s a no muss no fuss place. I\'ve been to some really upscale looking and service McDonalds! Lol. I wanna go to the one in West Philly where they placed chess there! hahhaa. Im telling you Im becoming a McDonalds expert! I guess it is what you make of your McDonalds experience. ;-) Too bad this location no longer has my favorite drink Powerade... That\'s why I no longer go there. This is the worst mcdonalds I ever been to....everyone that works there is so ignant and disrespectful...the BBW that worked the drive through was about 6\'6" she looked like a retired wrestler....I hope you read this you bumbs Why is it some McDonald\'s are just better than others?  This isn\'t one of those McD\'s!  Stopped in for some McGrease breakfast and went to wash my hands before eating and almost barfed at the smell in the bathroom. There\'s a WalMart next door. They need to go there and buy a bottle of bleach. After I regained an appetite had the hash brown and it was cold and oil sogged. I wasn\'t expecting 4 star dining but was hoping for minimum bar at McD\'s Went there for lunch while doing errands. The drive-through person didn\'t confirm my order at any point and so I didn\'t realize they didn\'t get part of my order, and the part they did get they screwed up (Oreo instead of M&M McFlurry). Also, saw some mice right outside the back entrance. Food is always great, but I called to place an order and customer service was horrible, guy taking the order acted like he didn\'t want to take it, he almost made me hang up, I would\'ve ordered else where if I wasn\'t so hungry. Overpriced garbage. Salmon and shrimp were over cooked, rice was old and vegetables were hard. Everything was sitting in a huge layer of margarine not butter. It\'s obvious they use cheap quality products. On top of the poor food, their customer service subpar. Do yourself a favor- don\'t order here!. If you want shrimp, just go to Sid Bookers. I ordered a salmon platter earlier this week. The customer service was horrendous and the food was subpar. I won\'t be patronizing this establishment again. The entire staff needs to learn that your goal is to make the customer want to patronize your establishment again not run the other way!!! #DONTBUYFROMSEAFOODSENSATIONS Ordered food at 615 PM at 7:30pm called they said it just came up I will get in 15-20min. Called back at 8:15 no answer. So I will never order from them again HORRIBLE FOOD !!! Horrible service!!! \nI ordered a turkey bacon egg and cheese because I am allergic to pork! And sure enough they gave me a sandwich with one egg & pork bacon!! When i reported that it was the wrong order, they said it was the correct order! IN WHAT WORLD IS TURKEY BACON AND PORK BACON THE SAME! The sandwich looked like a child made it. Disgusting! I immediately threw it in the trash n would NEVER order from there again!! Stay awayy!! So annoyed right now. I called to order a beef pepperoni pizza and my boyfriend left me his credit card info to order it. I was told they wont deliver it without his photo id. I stated he wasnt home at the time bc I wanted to pay over the phone. I was told "well will your boyfriend be back to show his id" when I explained he wasnt home. I was also told "we would hate to deliver and then cant give you your food bc you have no photo id". Like do you really think im trying to rip you off or commit fraud on a $13 pizza!! Never again!! This place is a scam!!!!!!! I had placed an order with one total amount & was charged a different amount. Meaning they over charged my account. I called & the retards told me it was my banks fault. I called my bank & they told me what I already know, which is my account was overcharged by them. This piece of trash restaurant also told me that other people have called "making up lies" saying that they overcharged their accounts with 10+ dollars. We are know doing an investigation on the situation & I will be making soo much noise on this. I will report this everywhere, you low life bottom bitch motherfuckers got me fucked up if you think you will get away with this. They also have gotten a couple orders of mine wrong, Do Not Order From Here!!!!!!!Makes Noise Dreams Will Come True! I would have gone 3.5 if I could. First time and ordered late on a Friday night. Order took 1hr but that was said when I gave my order, so it wasn\'t a shock. Pretty decent food. Had the chicken quesadilla, with onions and peppers. The veggies could have been cooked a little longer but it was good.  Also ordered the chicken alfredo pasta. Again not bad at all for a pizzeria.  I will definitely order again from here to see what else they have to offer. Horrible Service!!\n\nI\'ve dealt with the extremely rude servers on the phone plenty of times, yet I still ordered from. Now that the "cook" insulted me and my food choice as I was standing waiting (as crazy as that sounds) I\'ll be taking my money to one of the other million pizzerias in the hood. Never ordering from them again . I ordered a pizza online and waited an hr for it to come for them to tell me the ordered never came through but yet I got a order number  than they said they would give me a free pizza and it should take 20mins and still another hr passed by . Sad part is they only 10mins away of in a car. They really deserve 0 stars. I saw the bad reviews so I had to comment on this place.  I went on Uber eats and ordered a breakfast pizza with mega fries at 2 am.  The food came quickly, it was hot, and everything went smoothly.  I am not saying this is the greatest food in the world, but for under 20 dollars I was able to feed a small group of 4 and have leftovers.  \n\nUnderstand what you are getting into when you order from any late night spot in University City.  However despite that warning, not I or anyone in my group was disappointed with our order. Horrible horrible horrible customer service ! I ordered food at 7:45 and didn\'t receive it until 9:15 when I received my food it was cold and now have to wait another 15-30 mins for them to prepare my meals again ! Mind you I spent almost 30$ and after all of there fuck ups I still didn\'t get compensated for there mistakes!!! First & last time placing an order. Everything was drowning in grease! I trashed majority of it after taking a few bites Don\'t waste your money. Service is shady and unprofessional. Not worth the 1 star I gave them. The lady behind the counter is slow and inept. In retrospect, I\'m worried, that she was away for so long with my debit card. \n\n6/3/16 3:50 -4:50pm It took some time, but I finally ordered a pizza from Pete\'s... you know they\'re known for that right? I told you in my old review that they could be called Pete\'s Steaks because they get that right... well they didn\'t get the pizza right and I guess that\'s why it took me so long to finally try it. I don\'t know what it is with pizza places in Philly (in the neighborhoods mind you). They are just consistently stingy with toppings and Pete\'s is no different. Not to mention this joint had big hard air bubbles around the edges. They put all the toppings in the middle of the pizza. For all of that, they could\'ve just sold me the middle of the pizza and ring around the rosie\'d those air bubbles off! \n\nWay back the pizza was cool. I\'m gonna pass from here on out and stick to the steaks. The staff have an attitude their hot wings suck when they give u the wrong order they won\'t change it they want feed u what they want They take very long time then still expect tip  I ordered through grub hub and it said it\'ll be here in an hr. Then an hr and a half later it still wasn\'t here... I ordered my food @ 8:25 and am just getting my order @ 10:15. I called and spoke to the manager, who is always nice & hospitable. i told him my food took almost 2 hrs. to get here and of course it\'s cold. he apologized and sent me another order within 30 minutes. that\'s how you treat your customers. As someone who could hit Pete\'s with a football from his bedroom, I give them a lot of my business. \n\nHowever, it\'s more than geographical convenience that makes Pete\'s one of my favorite quick-order spots. Everything I\'ve tried on the menu is good to great, service is fast (they have a half-hour delivery guarantee which gives you half your money back if they fail) and prices are fair...or as fair as ordering out can be in 2013. \n\nPete\'s uses beef pepperoni as opposed to pork. I\'m not sure why they do it other than that Philly has a large Muslim population. I eat more pig than Kermit the Frog, so pork pepperoni wouldn\'t bother me, but the beef pepperoni is actually quite tasty. You probably wouldn\'t be able to tell the difference if I didn\'t tell you, but it was worth mentioning.\n\nThe inside is just a place for you to order/pick up your food. There is enough space for you to do that and leave. There are also two tables in a space for 1.5 tables so things aren\'t too comfortable. You don\'t really need to be lounging around a pizza shop bothering the piesmiths anyway, so you\'ll be fine. \n\nPete\'s also has two outdoor tables for those who wish to enjoy the beautiful cityscape of West Philadelphia (lol) and a couch/bench outside the front door so people can...wait for the bus or something. I don\'t know. It\'s there.\n\nAll in all, Pete\'s is a very good example of your common neighborhood pizza joint. The food is good, the service is...serviceable, and I don\'t really have any complaints about the place. Here\'s to you, Pete\'s...talk to you guys later this week. I happen to work right by here and its one of the few places that actually make real breakfasts, so I decided to try them. Their food prices are actually the best I\'ve seen for a while, and their food is pretty decent, from the couple of things I\'ve gotten from here. I ordered a bacon and cheese omlette, and it came with choice of home fries or grits, and toast. I\'m not a grits person so I got home fries. the omlette could\'ve been a little more cooked, but it was delicious. same with the home fries. The only complaint I have is they say 30 minute or less delivery and we ordered lunch from there yesterday and it took almost 50 mins. other than that...amazing. Nice staff, a little loud, but definitely a great place with great food. While not  the absolute best pizza (especially at over $2 for a plain slice), they are pretty decent and provide, quick friendly service. \n\nSince I quit my not-that-great office job, I am back at my Cobbs Creek canvassing office and have explored more of West Philly. \n\nDecided to stop in here for lunch since I arrived about 20 minutes early as the 42 also did to 48th to Spruce by about half as much. \n\nAs I said, everything went smooth as I received  my pizza piping hot in a mini box. 2 indoor tables for customers as well as an outside one for those nicer days. Place is very clean, as well. \n\nWill return. I was highly disappointed with the qulity of the food i ordered. I asked for a cheesesteak with sweets and hots cookied on the flat top woth the steak and i got the total opposite. Big pieces of pepper on my steak and the toll was hard. I wont be going back here. I have to say I love Pete\'s Pizza! It\'s been a tradition for me for about 3-4 years now every Friday and Saturday night. I usually order a large cheese pizza with parmesan cheese. They are usually always on time or they get there earlier and suprise me but I would recommend Pete\'s Pizza to anyone who loves pizza as much as I do, and if you do just try with parmesan it\'s really good! first time I ordered from here, the food was cold by the time it arrived. I live only a few miles from Beijing Panda, so I image my food sat in the restaurant for quite some time before leaving for delivery.\n\nI decided to try their food again hoping for a better experience. Unfortunately, it was worse the second time around. I ordered the house friend rice, wonton soup, teriyaki steak, and crab rangoon. Everything was inedible except for the crab rangoon, which I drowned in duck sauce. \n\nDo NOT recommend. The people are rude and the delivery time is ridiculous. Waited 2 hours for food and it never actually arrived. When I called to ask what the issue was, they said the food was already on the way. Poor management and even more poor customer service. What a waste. I live less then a mile from this place, we ordered $30 worth of food. Took over an hour for the delivery & the food was cold & dry when we received it. My husband called the restaurant they said "sorry nothing we can do" & hung up on him. We took the food back to the restaurant & asked for a refund. The staff was beyond rude, but eventually 1 staff member agreed to refund us. They have done a good job since taking over Lou\'s Wok.  Much friendler,  better food,  and the place looks 100% better then before. Ordered food two hours ago... Food was expected to get to us at 9:50. Called they said it was gonna take another 30 mins. Well over an hour later and Still haven\'t received the food, place is now closed. Never again. The food took over an hour to arrive to my house even those I live 5 minutes away. The food was cold & needed to be reheated. I ordered shrimp & broccoli. It wasn\'t the worst I\'ve ever had, but the shrimp were not fresh. The menu looked promising. We have dietary restrictions and severe food allergies. After asking clear and concrete questions about the ingredients in specific foods and were assured we could eat them; imagine our concern when we found out on the next visit that we were completely mislead. We were very clear about whether the vegetable soup was vegetarian and what it contains. We were shocked when the next time we ordered the same soup to find out that the vegetable soup is chicken based. Completely frustrated and annoyed! NEVER again. My last experience wasn\'t a good one. I will report the cashier who I will not name to corporate. I wanted a whopper veggie burger. How hard is that. Make the damn burger. Cashier asked me why I wanted a veggie burger. The answer is simple, because I\'m payin for it. She said rudely "I didn\'t asked you that."  I was like whatever. Then she was like you don\'t eat meat, the burger has bacon on it. I didn\'t care. That\'s what I wanted. Black folks dees days hmmmmm....................? This place has improved since the remodel. The employees seem more professional now than before, and I don\'t see mice running around in the kitchen area like I use to see before the renovation. Okay, it\'s Burger King. The food is the same as the bunch.\n\nThis review is based on my experience. We went through the drive thru. We kept having to ask the order taker to repeat what she was saying. And, she kept asking us what we were saying. When I pulled up to the window, she seemed checked out and low energy. Her attitude radiated "I don\'t want to be here."\n\nI kind felt dismissed and rushed off the way she handed me the food. I made the mistake of not checking her handy work, especially after seeing how into her job she was. Well, when we got home my wife did not have her Large Popcorn Chicken, but they sure as hell charged us for it.\n\nIf it was closer, I would have driven back. However, it was 25 minutes away and just not worth it. Stopped here only because I had worked a 16 hour day and needed to grab something quick for my husband for dinner. This is what I received. Mind you.. I had to wait five minutes for them to "make it fresh". Times change. Things change.\nStill one of the friendliest staffs I have delt with (the one delivery man has been with them since I started ordering here, even though the main manager seems to have changed... I think they expanded.)\nThey are EXTREMELY fast and it is rare when I don\'t have my food in 20 minutes.. I can\'t say I think I will ever choose not to deal with this establishment.\nWhy the drop of one star from my last review then?\nThe food quality is suffering.  The prices have stayed about the same... but the food has changed.  The shrimp is... questionable at times... the dumplings make me sad (literally)... and the Shrimp Toast... I just can\'t even... it\'s like losing a best friend.\nThis isn\'t necessarily the end of a beautiful thing... just the start of a more limited relationship... I still love you, boo.... \n(But seriously... the singapore chow mai fun is an obsession for me... Never Change!!! =\') ) As far as the greasy spoon, corner store/Chinese food spots go, this is the place to be.... errr, rather, the place to take out from/get delivery from.  \n\nWe won\'t get into why this all matters, but they have a decent selection of your low end tobacco products, including Newports, Blacks and Milds.... and blu....errr, Cigars (-_-) \n\nMoving on to the food.  Very low on the price, and very delicious on the taste.  This is some of the best food you can get for this price in the area and you can look right back into the kitchen/cooking area which makes you feel a bit more safe.\n\nThe candy that they offer is pretty amazing too.  Delivery comes within about 25-45 minutes, if its a Saturday night, 50 minutes tops.  You really can\'t beat this place, and the quality of the food almost outshines some of the nearby, so called, upscale Chinese dining.  I\'d bank on not being disappointed if you go here! Never again will I order from here. I got the Chicken wings in garlic sauce with beef lo mein platter. The veggies were so discolored from being overcooked. The chicken was hard and it didn\'t taste like garlic sauce at all. The best thing was the soda. In the land of bad food, this stands out as a solid example of the \'worst of the worst\'.  I work in the area, and I\'ve long since come to realize that there is nothing within 5 blocks of my place of business worth eating, and only a few places I would eat from in a pinch.  The New Imperial is a place I will not try again...thanks Claude B., for absolutely nothing.\n\nWon-ton soup was atrocious..not the first bad won-ton soup I\'ve had in this area either BTW.  The broth was odd and off-putting and the \'meat\' inside the won-tons tasted awful.String Beans in Garlic sauce was edible...barely.  That\'s about as positive as I can get.  Save your money and hit Wendy\'s or McD\'s.\n\nlike I said Spence, stick with Food Lion King Time...Best of the Worst. I won\'t even wait to rate the food - after an hour and a half wait for a simple order to be delivered .5 miles, I called and cancelled my order. \n\nThere is NO excuse for this kind of customer service. Went in there for the first time the other day and service was okay.  Their cash register appears to be broken and the place is in desperate need of a makeover.  The bullet-proof glass is kind of silly, but I presume if you\'re taking cash only and selling cigarettes out of the same joint, you need to be prepared (I don\'t think they\'re open that late either which is odd.\n\nThe service was relatively quick (maybe a 10 minute wait for the meal) and the food is what you would expect if McDonalds were to change gears and open up a Chinese Food joint.  There are no chairs - the orders are to-go only.  Extremely inexpensive as well.  Around $6 for a whole lunch including egg-roll (which wasn\'t half bad).  The rest of the meal, however, wasn\'t really anything special.  Two stars for effort. FOOD POISONING: Do not eat here. I purchased their general tso\'s chicken and brown rice lunch special. Though it was cheap, the chicken was undercooked and the rice was old. Their wonton soup was nasty as well. I\'m not sure if it was one thing I ate, or a combination, but I am 100% sure that New Imperial Chinese Resturant gave me food poisoning. The pain was not worth the price. Imperial is second-rate at best in terms of its customer service, but when you\'re craving Chinese and don\'t have that much cash to spare, it works.  They do deliver, but require a minimum purchase of $10 for it to be free.  On that note, in bearable weather, I\'ve gone by foot to pick up my food.  My biggest beef with this place is that I asked for and paid for a drink, but when I proceeded to dig into my food, the Snapple was nowhere to be found so I walked back to get it.  The woman at the counter seemed annoyed that I returned, but at least she believed me when I said I paid for my drink and didn\'t make me pay for another one. I order from this place all the time not because the food is spectacular but more for convenience and the kids like it.  They don\'t know any better.  Straight up....the food isn\'t that good but I can never seem to find really good Chinese food in Philadelphia and definitely  not in this neighborhood.  The shrimp fried rice is cooked and then steamed shrimp is added afterwards.  The result is a really bland and tasteless dish.  The sesame chicken is ok but if you eat that enough times it starts to lose it\'s appeal.  If you order from them you might want to specify how you want your food done otherwise you get the tasteless special.  Also when you order on Grubhub the lady that delivers (think she\'s the owner) is too lazy to get her ass out of the car.  She\'ll call you to tell you she\'s outside or sometimes has the little kid running out to your door.  She\'s lazy as hell. Awful. Terrible experience. Ridiculous customer service. They delivered my sweet and sour chicken without the sauce (DUH, how could you forget THAT). After I paid-including a tip- and called requesting the sauce, the woman was extremely rude and screamed at me that they were very busy and didn\'t know when they would be able to bring it! Maybe 45 minutes! Hunh?!?! Never. Again. Mind you, I live 10 minutes by car from this place. Ugh. So over it. Was kind of disappointed.  Lo mein was good.  Steamed dumplings were good.  Sweet and sour chicken was good.  Pork fried rice, so so.  Mongolian beef, which is supposed to be a specialty, was the worst I\'ve ever had.  Beef\'s color looked more like pork.  Highly disappointed in it.  Not a terrible Chinese take out spot, but cannot recommend it to anyone. Not too good, chicken wings too greasy and not fried hard, first and last time ordering from them. This review is born not out of mediocre food, but out of horrible service by the woman running the operation...take this as you will because I will not be updating my review later to indicate my thoughts on the food. I used GrubHub to place a very basic rainy day order, an egg roll and won ton soup thinking it was better to use the app and spend $3 by debit rather than using their ATM to accommodate the $10 card minimum requirement. The app indicated that this order would take an hour to complete, but that seemed a little excessive for such a small order so I popped into the storefront since it was on the way to my destination. I asked if the order would really take an hour and the woman at the register started going off about how I should not place an order and think it will be completed immediately. I told her that I did not expect her to expedite my order, I just wanted to know if the estimated time was accurate so I could run my errands and then come back. She then started angrily telling me that I should not use the app for $3 orders because she doesn\'t make any money that way. I\'m sorry, what? Why on earth would you list your business on an app built for convenience if you\'re going to yell at your prospective customers for using it? Instead of being berated for my use of an app built out of convenience, I walked out and had Grubhub cancel my order. Customer service apologized profusely even though it wasn\'t them that I was miffed with; kudos to Grubhub for addressing the matter, but a big thumbs down and no further business from me to New Imperial. Would definitely say this was not the best Chinese food I have ever had. I had ordered a quart of the Hunan Chicken and received a much smaller plastic container than I receive elsewhere when I order a quart (was given the shallow plastic dish and not the deep plastic dish). Usually, I am full with 1/2 of the food left over for the next day... well, I ate everything and was still hungry.\n\nMy GF\'s tofu with garlic was deep fried (not simply cooked and sliced as depicted on the photo) and the sauce was definitely not garlic sauce (upon tasting it). The only reason why my GF ate it was because she did not want to waste food.\n\nHere comes the kicker. For ordering a good amount of food we received jello and watermelon - WTF??? This is a Chinese restaurant, supposedly... arent they supposed to give wontons or egg rolls as comps? Completely disappointed.\n\nSuppose I should be glad we were not shot, given the bullet proof glass windows in the establishment. If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered on grubhub called to confirm because it was late then it never showed called to asked what happened and they said they had cancelled my order after saying it was on the way. Very rude. Very unprofessional. I used to call this place every a few times a month to get to work. I\'m done. They are always late.  If their credit card systems don\'t work the drivers ask you 15 times if you have cash. If I had cash I would have taken a bus, because it would have been quicker and more pleasant. I am absolutely livid with the service I received from a cab driver who works for this company that I needed to write a review. I had a bus to catch to New York this morning and I call this cab company when others I call are unresponsive, telling them I need one sent to me ASAP. They told me that they\'d have one sent to me within 15-20 min after I called them. It\'s ten minutes before my bus leaves and I still don\'t hear back from them. I called them again, informing them of this and that\'s when they manage to send me a cab to my door in minutes. The cab driver pulls up, my patience is close to none at that point. One of the bags with me was too heavy for me to carry and I was visibly dragging down the steps when he arrived. I curtly ask the man to please help me with my bags and he refused to help me because he didn\'t like the way I asked. I repeatedly ask him and tell him over and over its too heavy for me to carry and he kept refusing until I lost my patience and we end up arguing in front of my apartment for 15 or so minutes. He was literally yelling at me "I\'m not your maid! I don\'t help you with your bags! I have The right to refuse service to you! You\'re treating me like a slave and I\'m not your slave!" It escalated to the point where he was close to refusing service to me and was ready to call the cops on me because he was claiming that I was treating him like a slave.  Mind you, I\'m already stressed out that I\'m late, that cabs I have called before this guy have not been responsive, and then this guy comes and when requesting a simple and helpful gesture that would have made things move more smoothly, he decided project his victim complex at me. Had I not needed to be somewhere at that moment I would have let him go. I still paid for the ride, even though I felt he didn\'t deserve more than a dime from me for such pettiness that wasted so much of my time. Luckily I still made it to where I needed to be on time, but it definitely wasn\'t for the help of this cab company. I don\'t know the name of this man or his cab number so I can\'t complain directly, so sharing this review is my way of getting this out there and letting the whole ordeal go.\n\nIf that guy wants to make a living off of anyone he needs to cut the hurt ego bullshit and do his damn job. I hope he learns that soon. I\'m really not that type of person who publicly gives someone or a company a piece of my mind, but over the past year or so, this company (dispatchers and drivers) could care less about some working customers getting to work ON TIME.  I pretty much take a cab every morning to work, so these cab companies have been making a pretty penny from me.  I make sure to call at least half an hour or more before I start work, and I am very punctual and loyal.  When I\'m concerned, I call to find out where the driver is after at least 10 minutes or more of waiting (there is this unspoken rule to give driver at least 10 minutes).  Well, the same female dispatcher I can\'t seem to get around, is trained to be instant defensive and argumentative.  I think she forgets that I am a customer, who doesn\'t want to be late for work again, who wants to remain loyal, but doesn\'t want to deal with "He\'s on his way" after I ask where he/she may be, or "It\'s been 8 minutes, not 10", rather than checking up on the driver.  Always an attitude when I inquire about where and when.  Whomever says that the dispatchers are "patient" and "caring", may be either confused with someone else, or rarely cab it to work, so see a snapshot of the experience.  Rarely if ever are the 666 6666ers ever pleasant.  (I say rarely, implying that one dispatcher may be pleasant from time to time).  I won\'t get started on the drivers....I\'ve had such a mix of personalities over the years, more mean than courteous.  Companies who rate customer service second or third class, shouldn\'t be dealing with people.  They should take these Yelp reviews seriously.  It\'s obvious I\'m one of many who feels the same way.  If you check out the end where it says something about reviews that weren\'t considered, read them to see those "5 stars" were manufactured by employees or friends/family.  Pathetic and so obvious... I was charged twice for a $79 ride. When I called the dispatcher to fix the situation, he repeatedly told me he wasn\'t my driver and couldn\'t help me. When I went to the curb app inquiring about a double charge, it said to contact the taxi company. I called the dispatcher again and he literally hung up on me. I\'ve never had such rude customer service in my entire life. Had to dispute the charge with my bank. Taxi is pac manning across multiple lanes northbound on 476 driving 15 under the speed limit blocking up traffic for miles. Never ever get in one of these cabs. Reserved a cab the night before we needed it. Asked for a van to accommodate a group of 6, which they said was no problem. Cab was 10 minutes late the next morning and was not a van--only had seats for 4. Will skip the hassle and just call an Uber next time. Supposedly has an online reservation system, but despite receiving a confirmation email, no cab will show and when you call they will say they never got the information. This has happened to me twice, and to two of my friends. Don\'t trust this company -- they will NOT show up. Excellent service. I use them often because I travel for work and take a cab home from the airport almost every weekend. Cleanest cars in Philadelphia, pleasant drivers, reliable dispatch. Nice atmosphere\n\nAttentive staff\n\nAverage food....at best.  The calamari was rubbery...probably the worst calamari I\'ve ever had.\n\nMy boyfriend\'s ravioli\'s only came with 5, and they weren\'t very big at all.\n\nOnion soup was meh, average.  I wouldn\'t have gotten it if I had known...it tasted really artificial.\n\nI got veal medallions, and it tasted like garlic and oil....everything on the plate was pretty bland.  It kept making me burp all night and retaste that crap too blech!\n\nFor the price, I expected better. I should have realized I was in for a disappointment as soon as I walked in.  I can appreciate a place being \'under construcution\' but there are acceptable limits.  The food was meh, the service was meh, and the atmosphere was meh.  I was rather torn on if I should even bother to write this review. Well this location had not been hit up yet for reviews even though it has been there forever. I have been quite a few times. Nothing special. Their desserts seem to be their strong suit. Wait staff are a little dim. We have someone with a seafood allergy. We inform our waiter of this. This person orders chicken alfredo. He is receives his plate and begins eating. Yup you guessed it. For some reason there  is shrimp mixed in. We left immediately hoping to get some benedryl & avoid having to go to the emergency room. \n\nStupid servers aside the food is not good enough to go back for. The dishes are mostly over-cooked pasta with a high price tag. I am not all impressed by their "brick oven pizza" it was bland and dry. I really could care less about the service... I get takeout ceasar salad, eggplant florentine, and spaghetti pomedoro (sp?) adn Im happier than a pig in mud.  And my boyfriend likes their shrimp fra diavolo! \nSo I reccomend it for reasonable, regular good ol\' italian...I would like the noodles a bit more al dente though The Italian Bistro is the city\'s culinary Chernobyl, which is quite apropos given the staff and clientele\'s penchant for being russian and/or from the Soviet bloc.\n\nI went on their website before actually deciding to go here (my parents had a gift certificate, which is really the only reason we were there) and it said that they had a new menu.  I looked at the menu and it seemed to be a big improvement over the previous one (with the addition of wood fired pizzas, etc.) so we decided to go.  Big mistake.\n\nOur waiter was a strange russian man.  He didn\'t even give us menus until about ten minutes after we were seated.  He came up asked us what drinks we wanted (we didnt have menus) and then realized we didnt have menus and quickly got them for us.  He then brough us italian bread (best part of meal).  As we looked at the menu, he walked by with a Salmon special, put in under my girlfriend\'s nose and said "Dis iz our salmon special".  We were never properly told the specials.  He just was delivering one to another table and let my girlfriend smell it.  It was one of the more bizarre things i\'ve ever experienced.\n\nMy father ordered an appetizer plate, which wasn\'t very good.  It had two shrimp, two mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and calimari.  The calimari was primarily the heads and tentacle of the squid, which sucked.\n\nOur entrees came.  They sucked as well.  I got the fra diavolo.  It sucked.  Everything sucked.  It was one of the worst meals I\'ve ever had in my entire life, and I lived in Haiti for two weeks, so that is saying something.\n\nDo not go to this place, it is terrible.  The clientele is even worse than the food and the service. The place has gone down in last couple years.  I used to frequent it (living 5 minutes away), but then the menu items got bland and the deserts lost the home-made feel.\n\nAbout half an hour ago, I stopped by there with my wife to grab some desert and coffee.  To my surprise the cappuccino/espresso machine was broken and the deserts were so poorly made that I though of them coming from nearby Acme.\n\nPlates and spoons!!! were ice cold, whipped cream was runny, tiramisu was a combination of dry lady fingers with cold cream and little coffee or chocolate flavor.  Creme brulee was cold with barely caramelized crust.  I would be that it spent a few days in the fridge.\n\nIn any case, I hope the place gets better and I would frequent it more, but for now, I am not stopping by for desert. Soggy pasta in unimaginative thick sauces. Wait staff far from professional (dont ask me what I ordered when you bring my dish, you wrote it down). Not a thing to make you believe the entire meal isnt from a freezer to a microwave. Italian.....bite your tongue. This place has really declined since the first time I went here about six or seven years ago. They have gotten rid of a lot of things like a separate pizza \'kitchen\' and seem to have gotten rid of quality also. \n\nItalian Bistro used to be packed, buzzing and have a line out the door. The place has been dead recently and I understand why. My review is from only two trips here, but one trip left me highly impressed as well as the party that I had brought there.  It was the rehearsal dinner for my wedding.  I had twenty-five people in the party including my Aunt who is very particular about the way her food is cooked who had no complaints as well as no one else.  We decided on them at almost the last minute due to their cost which was much better than other places around.  I had my reservations going in, and even when I met with the manager.  He was Russian, and that wouldn\'t have been a problem if it was the Russian Bistro.  However I didn\'t back out and the food tasted fine and there were no issues and the fact the manager was Russian is completely irrelevent after the meal.  We had two waiters assigned to our party and they both did a great job and both hustled and were on top of things quickly.  If you\'re going for a rehearsal dinner please be prepared to get fed so much that by the time the dessert comes you won\'t be hungry.  It was salad, tasting, sherbet, entree and then dessert.  I looked over some reviews and I only hope they were there on a bad day.  I know from my experience, and the other 24 people with me that day there were not complaints. We were so hungry. We walked through Chinatown opting not to stop. We got all the way over to the bus stops and figured out there was not a lot of stuff to choose from. So we stopped in here. \n\nLet me warn you, this is tourists central and when I say tourist probably 70% + were from overseas. If you have never been overseas there are some countries that follow a different rule of thumb when it comes to ordering, waiting in line, etc.... So, buckle up and get ready for a bumpy ride. \n\nWe waited in line having every tourist bump and brush against us. We finally had a staff member ask us what we wanted. We ordered and walked outside to grab a table. They marked our glass and our plate to show we paid. Oh, there are no refills on the drinks either so prepare yourself for that too. \n\nOur food was ready and we grabbed it to go. We had to jostle our way through the crowd to get outside. \n\nWe sat and enjoyed our philly as the meat was tasty and warm. The bread was crunchy and not over hard. The fries were good. I would eat here again. \n\nThe reason it is SO busy right here is because it is right by the double decker Hop On Hop Off tour buses. There is a buffet of \'chinese food\' available which I think you pay by weight and there is a decent size order off the menu available. Would we go back, sure. Would we avoid prime time hours so we could eat in peace, yep most definitely. This was the only place open at 8am in the morning, so naturally everyone on the tour HAD to eat here.\n\nFood was okay not great. But okay.\n\nFood was charged based on weight, so I didn\'t get that much. I also got a drink from the refrigerator and didn\'t realize it was opened until I left the place. Disgusting! Make sure you check everything before you leave the place. There\'s nothing really special about this place expect that it\'s located in a historical area of the USA\'s beginnings. \n\nI would not come here again. No, thank you. Avoid this place. The worker/owner here is super rude and didn\'t show any respect to the customers. Food here is weighed by pounds, too salty, cold and not cheap at all. Btw, it\'s CASH ONLY. The people running this place are extremely rude.  With regards to the food...  old, tasteless and dry.  Do not bother with this place This place was my only chance to have a cheesesteak in Philly and sadly I was a little disappointed. It was no better than the one I usually have at Subway.\n\nBut the other meat loaf that they served was rather juicier than the sub itself.\n\nGo only if you cannot go anywhere else to eat. If I could give a 0 star, I would. So we were here because our tour guide brought us here. Don\'t really used to get a heavy breakfast in the early morning. At the first place, we wanted to get a club sandwich or some kind of salad, where is located in the philly\'s, but there was a Korean guy told the server something in Korean, and then we have been told by the server that they were not going to sell breakfast except those buffet thing. Okay, fine. I chose some egg and sausages. When I went to check out, it was expensive. I would like to use credit card and I saw the credit card machine, but I had been told by the cashier that cash only. I felt really disappointed of this kind of business. A heavy, greasy buffet place. The few non-buffet items generally do not have prices posted on them. Very rude service - every now and then the proprietor will yell out, If you are not buying anything, you need to leave. I never write yelp reviews; I made an account just so I can warn you people that this is the worst place ever! For some very average Chinese food,  my plate ended up costing $20!! Should have cost no more than $10. I could have gone to a nice sit down restaurant for this price. The cashiers were rude, and unfriendly. I would recommend going ANYWHERE but this place... Regardless of the price, I loved this place. Buffet food was great. I\'m originally from Virginia and it was my first time visiting philly. Although I didn\'t get a chance to visit museums, I decided to try some new food around. Lot\'s of variety of food and they were actually really good. I would deff recommend to friends and family :) I\'m giving this place an additional bonus star for being open before 7, but the bagels are offensive to bagel-humanity. Overly dense, tasteless, leaves you feeling ashamed for what you just put in your body. And I know shame. \n\nOwners and employees, if you\'re reading this, and I know you\'re not, I may have more 7 am buses to New York, so please God up your bagel game. I totally agree with the reviews who said this is the WORST place they have ever go. The cashiers are soooooo RUDE. And somebody thought they provide Chinese food but they said they ARE NOT CHINESE. So They are cheating if they said the food is Chinese style. You should at least pay for $20 on your check. And you MUST pay for $20 first then you can use their restroom!!Good luck everybody!!! Very average to subpar food. The only good thing is that it opens early in the morning for tourists in bus tours. Do not go here unless it\'s your only option. The food is too oily and overpriced for what it is. Items are charged by pound at $8 per pound. Spent over $40 for a family of four. The cashiers are rude and don\'t care about the customers due to all the tourist traffic they receive. I tried to order a Philly Cheese steak as this was my only stop in Philly but the staff mumbled something about how they were not serving sandwiches while the buffet style food was served. The food wasn\'t bad,  but not worth the cost.  The people are hard to communicate with,  and not very friendly (which is opposite of most of the people we\'ve encountered in Philly). this cafe food is so sick，Korean opea a Chinese restaurant，WFT please closed this cafe，Korean can not cook real Chinese food.\nthe soup is so disgusiting，please close this cafe，I can not eat it and I feel uncomfortbal，the chasher has bad service，this cafe just use cash only，that means this cafe will pay little tax. why dont use credit card pay it？I just want give this cafe half star or no star，please let this cafe close This cafe is mainly prepared for Chinese tour groups. The price here is ridiculous, disgusting food with $8.99 per pound. The guide did not provide the guest other options so people can only go to this place. We all felt cheated. Great place for a quick lunch.  Lots of salad items to chose from.  Sandwiches galore.  Also a Chinese style buffet.  Did not try that but it looked decent.  \n\nPay by the pound.  Eat in or take out. Do NOT go here. Total ripoff. I spent $30 on an average plate of chicken and noodles that you could find at a cheap all-you-could-eat chinese buffet. Rude staff. Make sure you ask how much it costs per pound before buying. We made the mistake of visiting on the weekend. Please save your hard-earned cash on some real Philly food. May God be with you if you accidentally make the mistake of visiting this gross place.\n\nNot $\nMore like $$$$ This place served its purpose for us, we wanted coffee and snacks, and this place delivered. The bathrooms are quite an adventure, long lines for both men and women (single toilet rooms). We did not get any real food from the buffet, but everything looked and smelled good. I just came in for coffee but WOW, what a spread.  I was floored when I saw the hot bar full of everything breakfast related!  The coffee bar was clean and fully stocked with everything I could have ever needed, a wide variety of tea as well.  Pretty cool place. This place is full of people from traveling group in the morning which is a horrible thing. It\'s buffet style. The worse thing is that no credit card can be used in this place! CASH ONLY! Stopped in here for breakfast after tootling around the Bourse to find little or nothing open at 10 AM.  It is a buffet (per pound) much like Oh so good.  It was fine.  Just OK.  Nothing stellar.\n\nA good place to grab a quick bite - and right near all the Independence Mall touristy stuff. Went there for dinner Friday, December 1, 2017 & with my order I asked for a small cup to get water. I was told that they don\'t do that, they have to charge me for an empty cup. I have eaten at other Popeyes and never been told I have to pay for a glass of water or just the cup. Just bring your own water or your own cup when you go to eat at this popeyes (1516 chestnut st. Philadelphia). Horrible service, cashiers have extremely bad customer service. I did not appreciate how my box of chicken was just thrown on the counter with no respect for me as a paying customer, this type of service is just inappropriate and unacceptable! Popeyes normally ranks in the top 3 of my favorite fast food places, but... not this one. The spicy chicken wasn\'t spicy, and the meat inside was dry and stringy, and a bit rubbery. The line was very long, and the tables inside were very dirty. Not sure I\'d come back to this particular Popeyes. Where to start. Their service was not welcoming or easy to approach. Although they greeted us as guest, it really just felt like we were a number for their sales quota. I ordered a number 3 and even described what I wanted. The cashier changed it to spicy , when I ordered mild, and to tenders when I asked for the mixed pieces. \n\nWorse part was that I ordered not alot of food compared  to my group of friends and I ordered towards the beginning and still got my food last. Then it seemed she was confused with other customer\'s orders. Overall, not a good look or vibe from this location. Very untidy, the worker didn\'t even care, they stood behind the counter talking while the restaurant was filthy from the door to the register Okay. It\'s...Popeye\'s. The Chestnut location is waaay better than the S Broad one. Chestnut Popeye\'s actually gets the order right, and their chicken doesn\'t taste like it\'s been sitting out for 2 hours then reheated. I\'d like to think I\'m a connoisseur on Popeye\'s since I\'m originally from New Orleans (Louisiana is where Popeye\'s started), and I\'ve been eating Popeye\'s chicken since as long as I can remember.\n\nThe only thing that "annoys" me is when you ask for ketchup they only give you, like, 3 packets. I\'m sorry but are you rationing ketchup for some reason? But, it\'s not really a big deal. I can easily just go up to the counter and get more. Other than that, it\'s good, fast and I can\'t stop eating their battered fries. They\'re addictive. \n\nJust remember to go at a non-peak hour because the lines can get long and seating can be hard to find during those times. I normally love coming to Popeyes, but this last visit was a nightmare. I put my order in and was told it would take three minutes. Twenty minutes later, I asked about my order and was once again told it would be three minutes. Apparently this was because they never actually told the cook to make my order. After another five minutes, I was handed my order very unapologetically. Not even a single "Sorry" from the employees. It\'s a Popeyes, so the food is awesome, but they tried to charge me $1.99 for a cup of water, and said that they don\'t have "courtesy" water. I came here on a rainy cold Thursday night around 7:30pm. This place looks new-ish with the thousand flavor combination coke machine which is a nice touch but the chicken and biscuits aren\'t as hot and fresh as other Popeye\'s locations but the mashed potatoes was good. The restaurant was also fairly empty at this point in the night. It\'s Popeye\'s, so you know what to expect. You can get your fried chicken fix, but this location has a particular problem with beggars who hang hide at the entrance and beg as soon as you walk in.  They\'re able to easily hide from the staff there just because of how things are arranged. This is by far the worst customer service in Philadelphia. The entire staff is rude. The cashier\'s look miserable. While I waited in line I witnessed a cashier argue with a customer about a mistake that she made. Instead of apologizing and correcting her mistake, she proceeds to insult the customer. This location needs to be closed. Michael\'s has always been our "fall-back" restaurant, don\'t want to spend a fortune, not looking for fine dining, maybe on the way to do some food shopping. We ate there Friday night after a hard day at work & we were very pleasantly surprised. While the food is always good, this time my Chicken Fransaise  was excellent and my husbands meatloaf was delicious! The platters were moist, tasty and attractively presented. I asked if there was a new cook, and was told yes. Don\'t know if that is true or not but I saw & tasted a difference. As usual, the salad bar was really nice & everything was fresh. Great meal, and very good service. We highly recommend. I have not been there lately.  A bad experience at breakfast turned me off.  I ordered ham and egss the eggs were good but the ham was bad.  The service was good and the waitress was excellent. Food is average. Service is terrible...always. The waitresses seem miserable. Never coming for refills until you are finished your meal. You hear them complaining about each other or the lousy tip someone left them. There are so many better places to eat in the area. So I\'ve been to pretty much every branch of this place this Michael guy owns and there\'s not really anything that makes it any more special than any other diner I\'ve been to, but I\'ve never been disappointed with the food or the service.  It\'s pretty much just your average, standard diner food, though their desserts and milkshakes are good. I think it\'s ok. I don\'t understand why people are complaining about something being bland at a diner that\'s three bucks a meal. And of course they won\'t cook the steak right it\'s a diner lol. The cook prob has no clu how to cook meat properly. It\'s prob either rare or well done is all they know. You gotta go in with your hopes down its only a diner not a five star restaurant. Ok restaurateur. Many early birds but nice salad bar. Better for breakfasts. Michaels restaurant is closing for good today This place is really inconsistent. I\'ve had good experiences here and terrible ones. Most of my good experiences come from late evening/dinnertime or early morning/breakfast. In my personal experience, the busier the place is, the better everything is. And the more empty is it, the worse everything is. Maybe their A team works when it\'s busy, and the B team when it\'s not.\n\nOn my most recent trip my friend and I came here for lunch after a Target run. We both ordered wraps, though different ones. Service was good and timely, but the food...blech. I ordered my wrap without the dressing on it, but quickly realized that, for some reason, my wrap was FILLED with water. As soon as I picked up a half off my wrap, water spilled out the front and bottom of it. There was a thick puddle of water on my plate that made my fries inedible because they were so outrageously soggy, and the tortilla wrap had the thinness and consistency of wet newspaper because it was so soaked. After a few bites I couldn\'t eat it because it was making me gag, everything was so soggy. My friend said her wrap was all right, so I\'m not sure what happened with mine. It was like they dropped my whole plate in a tub of water on the way out of the kitchen and then put everything back on it and tried to serve it to me. \n\nI still get nauseous thinking about that wrap. I haven\'t been there since. STAY AWAY FROM THE BOULEVARD LOCATION!! Hostess was miserable, after seating us the waitress came over gave us menus and took our soda order. When she returned with the drinks she asked if we were ready, we said we still needed a minute. 10 minutes and she never came back. We went to the counter and the hostess was on the phone, i said we are tired of waiting how much for the sodas, SHE NEVER LOOKED AT US OR GOT OFF THE PHONE! Just rung up the sodas and that was it. We went across the street to IHOP instead. Took my mother in law here for Good Friday breakfast because she doesn\'t live far from there and likes it. I don\'t know why she likes it honestly. I had to send my western omelet back because it was so dry, tasteless and overcooked. They bring out another and it is still tasteless but now not overcooked. Potatoes were bland with really no flavor. She seemed to enjoy what she ate but not only was mine not good (but I ate it because at this point I am starving) but the place is sort of down trodden with most of the chairs in and booth seating I saw having large gashes in them. At what point do you just reappholster that? Gross. I hope she doesn\'t want to return because I will want to suggest going elsewhere. Disappointing. Wife and i had diner there today, mine was prime rib special was good, wife had chicken with capers, good, here is what didnt makecsense, entrees great but sweet potatoes were awful sugarry sweet, my veg medely tried to eat, cauliflower had brown spots, carrots had fuzz on them, parsely garnish was not green had yellow in it, carrots on salad bar totally mushy and tastless, beets no flavor, choopped liver was way over salted\n\nI have eaten at michaels chain always had good meals, this was disappointing Vicinity: Somewhat clean,\nStaff: Prompt and acurate,\nCustomers: Chill,\nBathroom: Fair,\nService: Pretty fast when i used to go,\n\n\nTo be honest, I haven\'t been to KFC in years because of all the growth hormones and grease in their chicken and foods. It tears my poor tummy up like crazy. But, when i did eat from them, the presentation of the food was always on point. No sloppy containers, no spills, no cold food. The people here are not very courtesy enough to ask you if you want any sauces. I really want to like this restaurant but, every time I go here I get this "I want to quit my JOB vibe." For once in a while, could people try to make the experience somewhat pleasant. This place is my last resort for a quick bite just because of the sad vibe. Pizza Hut pizza is my favorite pizza in the world. This location is the absolute worst! My pizza always takes over an hour to get here, it\'s cold, and to top it off, SOME of the drivers are RUDE! Tonight I ordered 2 pizzas, was quoted 40 minutes for delivery but didn\'t get it for over an hour..and when he got here, he banged on the door and rang the doorbell 7 times in a row. I mentioned that it was a bit excessive. His response was that he had to park down the street because there was no parking. Ummm you deliver in the city where street parking is the norm. Please don\'t take your frustration out on me. Of course my pizzas were cold too. \nI wish the manager or someone would care that their employees are rude and incompetent.\nUgh! Pizza delivery 45 min late and order was not complete manager did not care for customer concerns . Never never will order from this pizza hit I just had to come back and update my review.  \n\nI should have known the goodness of this location wouldn\'t last.  These fools in there are pathetic, lazy and irresponsible.  I hate to wait for my orders, which is why I go out of my way to make sure I give a place plenty of extra time to prep my food for carryout.  \n\nIf I order on PizzaHut.com, and they tell me that the food will be ready by 7:15, I won\'t even leave my house until 7:15 to ensure my food is ready.  But, on TWO occasions, it wasn\'t.  I once placed an order, and they never even started my food, by the time I\'d gotten there, 20 minutes later.  \n\nNever again... Do not waste your money or time at this Pizza Hut . We waited for 3 hours for them to deliver pizza and finally ended up canceling the order . This place is good pizza and they make it fast service the price is real good. My family always take out pizza for my kids. Thanks Ordered food online at 8:26 it is now 10:35 and the food is still not here. This location is not very far from my house but this is absolutely ridiculous. Called the place & the guy told me it was out for delivery at 10. This will probably be the last time I ever order from Pizza Hut. I can almost guarantee that the food will not be hot when it eventually arrives, if it ever arrives. After my friend warned me to not order from here, I did so anyways. It has now been 2.5 hours and no one has come. I am a five minute drive from this place. When you pay for convenience, you should get your food at a decent time. We tried this Pizza Hut at 23rd and Passyunk in South Philly the other evening for the first time and were surprised.  Ordered a deep dish with crushed tomatoes, extra mozzarella, pepperoni, red onions, and garlic crust topping (not the standard Pizza Hut crust topping).\n\nThe pizza was pretty good, but a little oily.  It was baked properly (just right), was well seasoned,  had very good tasting mozzarella, arrived within about 40 minutes, was hot, and the driver was pleasant and grateful for the tip.  I liked that the bottom was not burnt and that they cut each slice all the way through.\n\nThe pepperoni is not the real good pepperoni, though.  The few sliced red onion slivers were pretty burnt and shriveled (I wish they would dice the onions instead of slice thinly), the crust topping with garlic is very oily and very garlicky.  \n\nDecent price, but we caught the online special for $7.99 for a two topping.  Full price would be way too expensive.\n\nOverall, not a bad tasting pizza. I just want to express that I appreciate it when a restaurant reads its reviews and wants to improve upon the critiques received. I don\'t believe any of us really write reviews to put restaurants out of business, or give them credit where it is not due.\n\nAfter writing my review here, I did receive a message from the owner, apologizing for our pizzas not matching the descriptions on the menu, and taking responsibility for their not reviewing the menu description. They did say they did not wish to mislead their customers. I was also invited back, which I do appreciate, and will hopefully be able to take them up on this offer in the future.\n\nIf it only weren\'t for this holiday weight I\'m already trying to get rid of.....\n\nBut to be fair, I will do my best to make it back and give them another chance, because I do believe they deserve it.\n\nThanks Rico. :) This place takes so long to deliver. I waited 3 hours for my food and it was awful. Don\'t buy from here. The gist of it-\n\nPizza arrived 30/45 minutes late\n\nThe Pizza was STONE COLD!!!  I mean the box was freezing!\n\nThe 2 liter drink that was supposed be included with the meal? NUH UH- More like a 16 ounce\n\nAnd the worst part- While trying to eat the wings, since they were the ONLY correct and warm part of the order we found a HAIR (THINK 20 INCH WEAVE LONG) curly and wrapped around one of the wings. \n\nOF COURSE WE CALL THE PLACE BACK!! Though the delivery driver was sympathetic enough and tried to drop $5 off of the shitty-shitastical meal  THE MANAGEMENT WAS HARDER.  They finally offered to bring a new order of wings out. THEY NEVER CAME!!!!!\n\nMoral of the stroy- don\'t order from here unless you like the liklihood of head lice in your food. :) I shouldn\'t have ordered anything in the middle of the night since I am on a diet. This place must have been my freaking karma. \n\nOrdered a double cheeseburger - It was RAW, completely fucking raw on the inside, actual fucking puddles of BLOOD when I bit into it now in my burger box. I am just so fucking lost. I\'m legit going to take it downstairs and COOK it so I don\'t get ill. \n\nDidn\'t follow instructions on the wrap, legitimately gave us 2 small slivers of chicken in side of it. Didn\'t give my bf the right wrap (he asked for wheat). \n\nI\'m not even going to call them, I\'m just never EVER going to eat from here again. This is the worst food place in Philadelphia hands down. I can\'t believe I spent $14 for this disgusting crap. THE WORST EVER! Cold food! Ordered 3 items in my cart, and 3/3 items were wrong!!!   I\'m so disappointed I\'m actually yelping something. All I do is eat all day!!!!!  The food is really good head they have awesome cheese cake!!! Def try that out! The food here is pretty up to par with other Burger Kings, but the service...not so good. I understand that this location has not been open very long (about 4 months I believe) but wow, do not go here if you don\'t have half an hour to waste standing in line, ordering, and waiting for your food. The hours is 6am-10pm every day. but if you stop by at 6:30 am. the lights are still off.\nPost the right hours if you cannot live up to your advertisements. Horrible. \nThere was trash everywhere. \nThe 3 orders before mine were ALL messed up and the staff seemed indifferent. \nThe cashiers... obviously this was just a job to them. I changed something on my order and the girl just straight up walked away. She didn\'t say anything. I looked around and was baffled. Then she comes back with the manager (I\'m assuming) who was on her phone and I guess she voided the item. Customer service is key! And none of them had it. I will not be back. Service is awful here, and I don\'t mind saying that because I\'m currently a waitress so I know what it\'s like. This is the 3rd time I\'ve been here, and every time 3 out of the 4 employees on shift is standing around... While there are at least 5 people in line waiting to order. I ordered a small vanilla shake and one of the workers loudly complained about making it. Then after she made it, she went to give it to me and then quickly took her hand away as I was grabbing the shake, and said, "you like how this looks huh?" With a deadbeat face then gave it to me. And it looked awful. Wtf burger king. I came here for a birthday dinner. \n\n1. I told the hostess that I had a 7pm reservation and she told me the reservation was cancelled. I told her that I\'m confident my friends are seated because they just texted me. We walk in the main room and I spot my friends. Can you please check before telling me my friends cancelled the reservation? \n2. Ordered a mojito. There were no mints in it. Meanwhile my friend ordered some Philly flower drink and she had a ton of mints. What is a mojito without muddled mint? \n3. There was 8 of us meaning a guaranteed 20% gratuity for the waiter. He was getting irritable because we took too long to figure out what apps we wanted, poor service \n4. Got the braised short rib for roughly 30 bucks. Though the portion was big, it was bland and tough. \n\nOnly things that were enjoyable were my friends and the view. Buyer Beware: If you\'re coming for the view, forget it. Both the website photo and the one listed on yelp are dishonest, deceptive and very disappointing. They should know better than to make the public think that the view of city hall and all of the other structures are what the dining room sees: NONE OF IT IS VISIBLE FROM THE DINING ROOM. Shame on you!!!\n\nOtherwise, the food was very good, the staff very attentive and pleasant. \n\nBut listen, management, "Psst...we came for the view." Why do you deceive everyone into thinking you have the one on your website, when, in fact, you do not?\n\nWe won\'t be back. What\'s not to love about Level 33?  The view is breathtaking, after all.  You\'re seated thirty-three floors above Market Street (hence the restaurant\'s name) and if you can see past the looming lighted Aramark logo that dominates the skyline south of 12th Street you\'ll enjoy the best of Philly\'s skyline as you dine.  The wait staff are courteous and professional.  And my food -- from the butternut squash and lemongrass soup to the sea salt and caramel creme brulee -- was fabulous.\n\nSo why did I give Level 33 one star?  Because they handed me a wine list without any item pricing -- that\'s why.  I ordered a simple bottle of 2011 Ruffino Moscato d\'Asti and they charged me sixty dollars for it.  That was the total price for a business dinner for two, inclusive of coffee and desserts, and the unpriced bottle of wine doubled our bill.  You can walk into any liquor store and pick up a bottle of Ruffino Moscato d\'Asti for 11.99.  I expected to pay thirty dollars for it.  I was, in a word, bled.  \n\nMy advice to the owners of Level 33 is this:  Provide a wine list with itemized pricing for your customers or they will never return, because they will always, always leave your premises feeling ill-used.  For that reason and that reason alone I will never return to this lovely sky lounge, despite the otherwise excellent faire.  Farewell Level 33... The view of this temporary restaurant was pretty amazing, even better than the view from some other restaurants perched above the city. We got a prime spot looking at the Ben Franklin bridge and over the river. \n\nUnfortunately the food did not match the view. While the Crabcake was quite tasty and had a lot of crab meat, the Butternut Squash soup was very thin and the Seared Tuna tasted overwhelmingly of vinegar. Service was also slow and not attentive (we had to ask for butter 3 times before we received some). The views from up here are fabulous.  I shall not speak of the food because I did not want to try it.  Their bottled beer list is rather limited.  Luckily, they had good old Sam Adams to the rescue.  I sampled one of their mixed drinks that a friend got.  It was, as expected, cloying, but at least not terribly so.\n\nService at the bar was unenthusiastic but sufficiently competent.  The decor was chic - for the 1970\'s (they totally should have used the location in American Hustle).  I imagine its days are numbered as the hotel is getting renovated.  Drink prices were on the higher side, as you\'d expect from a place trading on its location, but not absurdly so. I love my Dunkin. Yes I do. But I hate this one. \n\nI work nearby so it\'s the most convenient location to come to. Unfortunately, the customer service here is just beyond terrible. You can tell that they dislike their jobs and they find no reason to make your visit even slightly pleasant. While taking your order they look at you as if the sound of your voice is like nails scratching on a chalkboard. I\'ve had such outstanding service from other Dunkin\'s that I\'m consistently disappointed because I always go in hoping that maybe they changed and got better today. Nope. \n\nAs far as the drinks go, it\'s ok. Problem being they don\'t take instructions well. There\'s a sugar problem here where there\'s either no sugar or too much. They often run out of items (especially muffins) and I\'ve had to bring items back for being stale. It\'s like playing roulette here trying to get a fresh muffin/bagel/donut. \n\nThe sitting area sometimes has vagrants and makes it a little strange if you decide you want to sit in. They also keep the lobby area completely filthy. The drive through is much less painless than walking in so I recommend that if at all possible. Another negative is that while its 24 hours, the lobby is only open until 5pm. That\'s very limited hours for this area. I wholly support Dunkin, but this location leaves a lot to the imagination. My general opinion is to avoid at all costs and if you\'re desperate, just don\'t expect much of anything and you\'ll be fine! Customer service here is a joke! I visited their drive-thru at 5:00am on a Friday morning. There were two cars ahead of me, one pedestrian at the pickup window, and no one was inside the store when I pulled up. I made an order for 2 Boston cremes with a lady, then nothing. I said hello for two minutes while no one responded to even confirm that they had heard my order. Only when I start to drive away does a gentleman ask me to wait a moment. By the time he speaks, both cars ahead of me had already driven away and the person standing at the pickup window was continuing her conversation. Another FIVE minutes later no one has yet confirmed my order, and the pedestrian is still talking to someone  at the pickup window, so I cancel. As I\'m driving away I can see both the gentleman and the lady who had tried taking my order having a conversation with the woman standing at the pickup window! Are you kidding me?? If for some reason you are unable to serve me, just say so. Clearly they don\'t care about their customers. Been there twice and will never go back. My discount wasn\'t applied and the cashier acted like she didn\'t know what I wanted . I have the app that I use everywhere without no problems. So sad because I live in the neighborhood. I will only use DD at other locations. BOOOOO.  why do dunkins in philly suck so much??  the only drink i ever get at a dunkin donut is an iced dark roast with cream and HALF sugar.  most of the time philly dunkin donuts don\'t get the half sugar part right, but this one didn\'t even have dark roast!!!  they made it sound like they just chose not to brew the dark roast that day.  how do you do that?  not ok.\n\noh, and they recently got their drive-thru intercom fixed/repaired/re-done?? and it is like 100 decibels loud.  i swear people a mile away could hear the lady telling me that they didn\'t brew dark roast that day.  hopefully they\'ve fixed this.  if not, wear earplugs.  but then again, don\'t bother going to this one.  find another dunkin somewhere else.  better yet, (not that i\'m a boston fan cuz i hate the red sox), but you\'re better off going to a dunkin in boston. Don\'t do it... the owner does not care who he hires---normally a questionable character from the neighborhood; no, like for real! And the food is never of quality ..want a salad?! Expect lettuce stems. Want chicken fingers or a chicken wrap?  Expect old chicken or raw chicken. The pizza is never the same.. the wing dings come like someone\'s chewed them up, spit them out and covered them in sauce. Let\'s not begin talking about "the Cheesesteak." You\'re kinda bullied into going to this spot if you live in the neighborhood because it\'s one of the only ones here... but I\'d rather spend money at the McDonald\'s up the street than eat here....at least you know what you\'re getting....sorta. lol The morning drive through order taker has the most miserable attitude. They sound like they would rather be ANYWHERE else. I can feel the apathy towards life through the speaker. But the window people are always friendly. Overall I\'m pleased with China Star! Just tried them for the first time tonight, and the food is better than the average chinese takeout. The garlic wings are smaller cheaper wings but are incredible! The garlic sauce has a great sauce that is comparable to finer sit down restaurants. \n\nAs an entree I tried something unique to their menu that I have not seen elsewhere. Pepper Steak with lobster sauce. It sounded like an odd mix, but I was wrong! It is delicious! Now I\'m absolutely full while also looking at their menu to see what I\'ll order next time.\n\nAn egg roll came with the meal. It is a decent basic egg roll, but I only had a bite since the rest of the meal was more than enough.\n\nSo, Positives-great food, open very late, and fair prices. Oh, and the delivery guy was pretty nice.\n\nNegative-Unfortunately, it is very difficult in ordering from them. I\'m willing to say that 20% of that may be indirectly my fault, as my leftover redneck voice from childhood may be troublesome to some over the telephone-but holy crap it takes a while to order. I had to say my street name at least 7-8 times, and spell it out each time. She then handed me off to someone else that completed my order, albeit in an equally slow fashion. beware!!!! first off, any food establishment that makes you pay prior to eating, is more than surely trying to trap you!! first warning is that the place looked closed when you oulled up becaue no one was there! i come from new york city, where all the chinese food cat jokes stem from!! in all my days i have never ever experience more disgusting chinese food or just food for that matter!!! i will be fair here, the true problem was that the food was extremely old, soiled!!! it had to be at least be a week old! the chicken was grey and dry as a bone and never mind cold. the crab wontons were spoiled!! cream cheese tasted like spoiled milk, the rice was hard and cold like it has been sitting in the fridge for days. the only thing that was decent was the salad because you cant mess up lettuce. i am extremely surprised this place is still in business and hasnt been inspected for their poor quality!!! if i had gotten sick i would have reported them myself!!! most horrible food experience i have ever had purely based on the fact that the food was clearly more than a couples days old to a week or more!! it\'s very disgusting.'

    'ive tried going here four times with no success because the drive tru takes so long that i have pulled away every single time. great job idiots! You get to wait 20 minutes even when first in line at the drive thru window. Now worth it - even of their fries are die-worthy! This is one of the worst McDonalds on ever been to it\'s so dirty the food is horrible customer service is the pits it is one of the worst worst McDonald\'s ever been into very unsanitary don\'t eat here I will try to keep this one as gentle as possible.\n\nThis place sucks.\n\nThis location is probably the most inconsistent one out there. Nothing is ever made on a good standard level that I know McDonald\'s can deliver. \n\nSometimes you get a sweet tea, it\'s great. Sometimes, it\'s bland. Sometimes, it\'s like drinking sugar. This goes for everything else on the menu. It\'s like gambling to go here.\n\nAlso, they do not like to give you your change (1 - 4 cents) back. I thought it was standard? I only had this problem on drive-thru though.\n\nIt is not "24/7 drive-thru" either. I went by around 4 in the morning, and was told they were closed. I guess they make their own rules! Oh, I love the Girard and Broad intersection. Flies all over and even though it wasn\'t crowded it took 10 minutes for someone to come to the register to help me and waited an additional  30+ minutes for my food and all I ordered was a sausage mcmuffin meal. And after all that I had to get out of my car and go back in because they forgot the hashbrown. This is the worst McDonald\'s on the face of the earth. Period. I strongly wish they get their franchise pulled it\'s an absolute joke. Expect to wait 20 minutes at least. Expect a very rude, not trained staff, THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. Has your staff ever been to a McDonald\'s before? I am a huge advocate for McDonald\'s and visit frequently but this one is so absolutely pitiful it makes me want to go across the street to checkers(eww). Definitely the worst McDonald\'s I\'ve been yet.\n\nGrowing up, I loved McDonald\'s even McDonald\'s himself had always looked creepy to me. (I\'ve always been a fan of the Hamburglar but never mind that) I adored their food and remember how big and plump the Big Mac seemed and not this mushed together thing that we\'ve come to known. Up until recently that I realized how bad fast food actually is and I\'ve swore off it for years. That is until now that my job has brought me to an area of culinary desert, we got nothing but fast food, fried chicken and a deli around the 4 blocks area. It\'s a dead zone.\n\nSo I\'ve retreated to fast food, a man\'s got to eat. Especially when the man is forgetful when he gets home and too lazy sometimes to plan his own lunch ahead.\n\nI\'ve been to this McDonald\'s 3 times for breakfast and lunch alike. While in surface, everything taste the same. This McDonald\'s is the most ghettlest of them all. Their cashiers have the nastiest attitude even I try to use thank you and please to force some customer service out of them.\n\nThe juice is half filled. When there is no ice in the ice machine, they just stand there and say they will refill it soon but they don\'t. They give you one napkin for your whole meal and there\'s no additional napkins to be found. They don\'t give you any ketchup or peanut or spoons for your sundae. They give you 1/3 of the normal amount of chocolate sauce for your sundae. Just a little on top like a suggestion that it is a chocolate sundae. The ice cream is also half-full (half-empty if you\'re a pessimist) and half-melted (half-solid if you\'re an optimist). It\'s not like I know them so I wonder why they act like I\'m the asshole who\'s bothering them by making them go get my food. No smile and full of \'tude. Is there no quality control?\n\nWell, it\'ll just make me want to bring my lunch more and hopefully keep me from being supersized Worst McDonald\'s ever. So dirty and the customer service is like shit. Don\'t go!! Flies all over the place and the foods are bad This McDonald\'s is a literal nightmare. I\'ve witnessed drive thru window fights. Literally, two people inside the window fighting the employees as they agitated. No one does anything here besides stand around. I got bitched at one day because some girl working the window handed me my drink and said have a good night and slammed it shut. Well, I ordered a meal, not a drink. When I beeped to clarify if she got my food order I was treated like some kind of imbecile because she could see my order "on the screen in here!" She "can\'t miss it!!"\n\nAvoid at all costs. If this was the only McDonald\'s left on this great planet, I\'d still eat white dog shit before dealing with these Neanderthals. Reviewing a McDonald\'s....yes, it\'s silly, but the public needs to be warned to never visit this one.\n\n2 stars: I can\'t knock this place for being unhealthy. When you intentionally visit a McDonald\'s establishment, you go knowing full well the consequences. So 2 stars for the food and impending heartburn. \n\n3 stars: The French Fries. Not going to lie. I would eat them right now if presented with those delicious golden bitches.\n\n0 Stars: The unbelievably terrible service. Now I know I\'m not going to receive a 5-star experience, but come on. One time my bf ordered a double cheeseburger and received it sans burger patties (only buns, lettuce, onions, ketchup), another time we ordered TWO STRAWBERRY milkshakes and received THREE VANILLA milkshakes. How is that even possible? 0 stars for incompetency. Don\'t even THINK about specializing your order.\n\nSomehow it also takes them forever and a half to get your order to you. So not only is it incorrect, but it is also delivered to your car just seconds before you decide to eat your shoes.\n\n0 stars: For only having meals after 10 o\'clock.\n\nGrand Total of 1 star...and that\'s a generous gift. Wish I could give ZERO stars. I was there 2/2/19 around 10:30 pm. It was not busy at all. Service was slow and the customer service was atrocious. To top it alll off I got a cheeseburger.. simplest thing, and they decided to add a ton of mayo.. why?? I didn\'t ask for that? So I turn around drive back and they are rude to me when I ask for a new one. I am like beside myself.  I love McDonald\'s and this location has just did me so poorly that I will never be going back. Learn how to hire better staff McDonald\'s. Smh. Sat in the drive through for 35 minutes waiting for my food, the order came out in correct, and waited an additional 25 minutes for the correct order. Not to mention the inside was completely empty.... not even a crazy busy night. Beyond frustrated Since I have to rate it one star for the win...... first off, I contacted McDonald\'s and haven\'t heard back at all. This particular store has no identifying manager so I\'ll say it\'s self run by the employees and it needs a manager badly, the staff is rude, the food gave me a stomach bug for dayssss and I mean days!, hygiene needs to be a serious priority at this establishment. Worst place. No one cares or wants to help. Rude \nWonder why??? Came for Temple game. No Temple students should ever go here 1 patty on a double cheeseburger...a susage mcmuffin instead of a sausage egg and cheese on a buiscuit...and oreo frappe instead of chocolate chip..no apple pie. This was all 1 order. Luckily it was postmates so i got it all free..but come on guys, get it together. It\'s not a hard job. This is not only the worst McDonald\'s I\'ve ever been to but the most repulsive joke of a food establishment I\'ve ever seen. The staff is rude and the food takes forever. When I got my food I was given ONE sauce so I asked for another and two of the staff looked at me, nodded there heads and looked away and completely ignored me. There were no napkins, no straws, no tea, no lids, the entire building was filthy and disgusting. It looked like It hadn\'t been cleaned in months. I wouldn\'t recommend this place to anyone. If you\'re on your way there please for your own sake turn the hell around. Wow, I wish I didn\'t turned in here to pick up food. Sitting in the drive thru for 20 minutes just waiting for my order but too scared to honk cuz I don\'t want my food to be spat on. Worst McDonald\'s ever!! They take forever and are rude. I never write reviews so you know a sis really not about it! They all need a whole new staff training because they suck Shoutout to these people who want $14 an hour but can\'t put any sauce in my 20 piece nuggets! Even though we asked to make sure they were in it. They aren\'t. Sad. Bring a chair cos you\'ll be waiting for 15 min or more to get your food. Breakfast sandwich, good luck. Might as well go to Dunkin donuts up the street or just wait for a while. They aren\'t following covid guidelines and safety precautions. Barely anyone was wearing a mask. Rude staff who refused to be helpful. I asked for a refund because the young lady handling my order had her mask around her chin the entire time and wasn\'t wearing gloves when touching my food. No gloves and no hand washing touching fries as she put them in the bag. The cashier was also not wearing a mask. This place is the worst McDonalds in the world. I know that sounds hard but this place is run by total morons, it is disgustingly dirty, the wait times are atrocious and the food (which should be exactly the same as any other McDonalds) is untasty and tossed in the bag like it was made by mentally deranged criminals. Stopped in this place for a Happy Meal on 05/16/2019. \n\nI can\'t believe this is an actual McDonald\'s! At first I thought that it must be a knock off one like the one in that movie, "Coming to America" w Eddie Murphy from way back. "McDowell\'s" or something like that it was called in the movie. At least the one in the movie was clean. This one, it\'s absolutely the worst one that I\'ve ever been in or even heard about!! Exceptionally dirty! Were those bug zappers on the walls? It\'s attached to a filthy,  blown out BP gas station. I. Just. Couldn\'t. Believe. This. Place. \n\nMcDonald\'s Corporate, what do they have on y\'all that you can\'t shut these guys down? Seriously, it truly shocks me that the City Health Department hasn\'t closed this place down. During the 20 minutes that we waited for our food we looked and looked for a Food Safety Rating but couldn\'t find one. \n\nStay. The. Heck. Away. In the words of my 16 year old daughter..."ew".  To call it gross would be offense to grossness.  The employees stare at you like they\'re ready to fight.  Apparently they\'re paid by the number of words spoken as they do more stating than interacting.  The food was fine which is factored into the rating of 1.  Here\'s the worst part.  I foolishly decided to use the restroom.  Apparently something died in there...2 years ago...is still decomposing...creating smells I didn\'t know were possible.  Apparently 9 of 10 patrons (or as I suspect employees) miss the toilet.  The bathroom door doesn\'t lock.  There are no paper towels or functional dryer.  The soap dispenser was apparently torn down in the late 70\'s.   Ew. Since I have to rate it one star for the win...... first off, I contacted McDonald\'s about this place and haven\'t heard back at all. This particular store has no identifying manager so I\'ll say it\'s self run by the employees and it needs a manager badly, the staff is rude, the food gave me a trouble stomach bug for dayssss and I mean days!, hygiene needs to be a serious priority at this establishment as well as customer service , safety sanitation, work ethic. This has to be the worst McDonald\'s ever. The people who work here don\'t ven know what they are doing and they look at you like you came from another world. I have nothing against new people in training but if you are in busy hours just have people that are already trained at the counter. I waited 50 minutes for two hamburgers. Incredible. Not coming back to this location. If you know what is good for you, you will avoid this place like the plague. A late night craving for junk food brought me to the drive through where I found a long backed up line of cars that wasn\'t moving because staff inside decided that they didn\'t feel like taking orders. They made excuses like "we\'re doing a shift change" and that the "headset was broken" (then how are you communicating with me through the speaker?). After at least 15 minutes the relented and finally took the order. While waiting for the order we watched the person working in the drive through window open the window and scream at a person passing by "I\'m going to f*****g kill you!" which left us absolutely stunned. We waited nearly 20 more minutes for the food, and when the order finally came out it was, of course, wrong. The employees only yelled at us and refused to fix it, so we just left and complained to McDonalds. The manager\'s mediocre response was, "I\'m sorry you feel we have let you down." McDonalds corporate should shut this place down. This McDonald\'s is the worst restaurant on earth. I\'ve never seen such disrespect , ignorant , non courteous people. Did I mention it\'s a haven for drug dealers and addicts alike . Even the employees are copping drugs . The neighborhood could be better if this place closed. DONT NOT PAY WITH DEBT/CREDIT CARD !!! \n\nThis location has someone who hacks debt/credit cards and then will go next door to the gas station and charge it to your card. I thought I got the situation taken care of the first time they charged $75 to my account but the bastard still has my account number and is now making more charges. I will find you ya scum ! Stopped her on my lunch break to grab something quick it.wasnt quick the drive thru was so slow and I waited 10 to 15 minutes to get my food . I ordered a minute maid slushy it wasnt even filled up the fries were cold and the chicken nuggets were dried out and rubbery tasting.  I do not recommend stopping at this locations food was horrible and the wait was too long Worst McDonald\'s experience I\'ve ever had. I had ordered a chicken sandwich but got a burger instead. I was in a rush so I just accepted the mistake but half way through I noticed there was mold on the bun!  Also ordered 10 nuggets but only received 7! These idiots can\'t even count. The staff are UNBELIEVABLY RUDE and slow, even by McDonald\'s in North Philly standards. Going to cut this review short because I\'m pretty sure I have to go vomit now. Literally the worst location I\'ve ever been to.  The place literally smells like ass and is ALWAYS dirty.  The population surrounding it is poor so they never have any of the "fancier" items like lattes, smoothies, etc even though they have it on their menus and have the machines to make them.   It\'s really just burgers, fries and soda here.  I ordered a coffee here and they the woman gave me a sandwich bag with sugar and cream as they don\'t even have the modern machines where you push the buttons to add the condiments.  Those things were put into McD\'s over a decade ago.  Never go here. Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI will never come here ever again. The service wasn\'t bad the the food was made sloppy. My sisters cheeseburger had hard bread on top and it was ripped on the side so they had to remake it. After drinking 3/4 of my drink I noticed mold on the side of my cup. I ended up paying $24 for a breakfast sandwich. When i called the store the man who picked up said " hey nigger why don\'t you cry to your momma, this is MCDONALDS." Really? I mean i guess thats it then.\n\n*disclaimer: paid in cash Just waited in the drive through line for 25 minutes...FOR TWO ICE CREAMS! So slow and rude. Ever since the Philly Police installed a mini-station next to the serving counter, this McDonalds really cleaned up its act.  Sure, the dining room and parking swarm with those huddled masses that didn\'t so much fall as joyously leapt off the wagon a long time past and retain little intention of climbing back aboard.  So, you\'re still in fine company.  In a corner booth sits Schizo engaged in lively conversation with his empty coffe cup.  In a middle booth you\'ll find Shakey aiming that McDouble for her mouth but hitting her cbheek.  Along side her, witness her buddy, Sleepy, nodding off and sweating, the poor fellow! \n\nBut, the old gang aside, in comes the law and out goes the riff-raff.  You won\'t be hassled for change while you eat, and the cleanliness no longer approximates an old movie house.  Your feet no longer stick to the floor after you sit up from a booth.  Each booth contains at least two fully sit-able seats.  Granted, the food still retains its urban McDonalds "flavor" and the atmosphere may be characterized as "questionable".\n\nHowever, the Broad & Girard McDonalds witnessed a stunning historic event its suburban counterparts surely and jealously long for.  In 1999, the Ol\' Dirty Bastard, ever the rascal, escaped from court-ordered drug rehabilitation and fled as a fugitive from the law.  An always vigilant Philly police officer recognized him, ran the license of his Jersey car idling at the drive-through window, and the rest is, as they say, history.  Let\'s have a mural! The worst McDonalds I have ever been to. They didnt even take my order at the screen, they took it at the window and had me sit there for 5 minutes before telling me. I waited over 25 minutes for my food and watched all the workers stand around not working.... The person behind me got their food before i did. Never go here, i will never be returning. Went here for a late night meal. I kid you not, when I got home with the food a cockroach crawled out of my burger. So needless to say this place is dirty, the people aren\'t friendly. There\'s always some sketchy things happening outside of the building too. Don\'t go here. No surprise hands down the slowest most pathetic place on the face of the planet... the morons at work here are lucky if they can count their fingers and toes. Slower than molasses in winter time I really can\'t think of anything else to comprehend the total inability to have the ability to work. They want $15 an hour you must be joking me ,  I wouldn\'t pay them $2 for the speed that they\'re working at. Other than that were in dire need of subsidence this place is a pathetic joke the manager should be fired the employees should be strung up and smacked with a wet whip... absolutely no care in the world for anybody other than themselves why do they work here get a job at Walmart you could probably get by better but don\'t leave us out here hanging hungry in the middle of the night I can cook a burger faster on my car hood... obviously extremely distraught this place is going to end me.'

#### Adicionando a categoria na predição


```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
```

*  Realizado o Encoder da variável categoria para o treinamento


```python
encoder = LabelEncoder()
#df_train['categories'] = encoder.fit_transform(df_train['categories'])
```


```python
df['categories'] = encoder.fit_transform(df_train['categories'])
```


```python
#X = df_train[['stars_x', 'useful', 'cool', 'funny', 'categories']]
#y = df_train['is_open']

X = df[['stars_x', 'useful', 'cool', 'funny', 'categories']]
y = df['is_open']
